# HRS alexa

An Alexa Skill application used as an example that integrates with the content API.  The code is a lambda function that uses the alexa-sdk.  Intents and Utterance models are in the `model` folder and used as a reference.

For now this just interpretes the statute id but this can evolve into a full machine learning service that uses the statutes to give information or answer any of your questions.

The skill is currently in beta.  If this is not yet active, please get in contact with me with your amazon email to be a "Beta tester".
