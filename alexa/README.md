# HRS alexa

An Alexa Skill application to show as an example of an application that integrates with the content API created for HRS.  The code is a lambda function that uses the alexa-sdk.  Intents and Utterance models are in the `model` folder and used as a reference.

This can evolve into a full machine learning service that uses the statutes to give information or answer any of your questions.

You can open the application from alexa by saying: `Open H. R. S.`

Example phrases include:

* `Open statute 1 dash 1`
* `What is the state bird`
* `What is the aloha spirit`

The skill is currently in beta and not published on the Amazon Alexa store.  If this is not yet active, please get in contact with me with your amazon email to be a "Beta tester".

## Requirements
* Node 6.*
