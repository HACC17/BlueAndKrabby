**ยง223-2 Quality growth policy.** The office of planning shall develop a quality growth policy based upon the following considerations:

(1) An examination of the environmental impact of proposed urban development;

(2) The relationship between short-term and long-term environmental quality;

(3) Any irretrievable commitment of resources through urban development; and

(4) Alternatives available to minimize adverse environmental effects as balanced against economic development of the State.

The quality growth policy shall include a comprehensive policy framework for directing growth and land use and shall identify State growth objectives and specific operational constraints to further such objectives. [L 1972, c 45, ยง2; am L 1993, c 213, ยง2; am L 1996, c 299, ยง3]
