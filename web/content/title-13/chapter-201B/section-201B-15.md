Case Notes

In action for declaratory and injunctive relief brought under this section, petitioner lacked standing to assert claims for relief where petitioner failed to allege or create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was an actual or threatened injury resulting from the authority's conduct or that the injury was fairly traceable to the authority's challenged action, and failed to establish that petitioner's injury was likely to be remedied by the court's grant of injunctive or declaratory relief. 100 H. 242, 59 P.3d 877 (2002).
