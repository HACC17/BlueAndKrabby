**§214-2 Funds, allotment, and expenditure.** Money allotted under this chapter by the State shall be available to the several counties; provided that no part of state or county moneys shall be expended for capital improvement projects which are not a part of the general plan of the State, or which will not reasonably contribute to the economic development of the county. The determination of (1) the extent of participation by the State, and (2) what capital improvement projects shall reasonably contribute to the economic development of a county shall be made by the governor taking into consideration the State's goal for specific segments of its general plan and the financial position of the county.
