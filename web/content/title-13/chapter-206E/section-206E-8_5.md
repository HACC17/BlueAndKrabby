In community development districts for which a community development plan has not been developed and approved in accordance with section 206E-5, parts II and III of chapter 205A shall continue to be administered by the applicable county authority until a community development plan for the district takes effect.

(1) Applicable county rules adopted in accordance with section 205A-26 for the review of developments within a special management area, except that paragraph (2)(C) of section 205A-26 shall not apply; and

(2) Part III of chapter 205A and applicable county rules for the review of developments within the shoreline setback.
