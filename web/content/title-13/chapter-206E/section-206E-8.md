**ยง206E-8 Use of public lands; acquisition of state lands.** (a) If state lands under the control and management of other public agencies are required by the authority for its purposes, the agency having the control and management of those required lands may, upon request by the authority and with the approval of the governor, convey or lease such lands to the authority upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the parties.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no public lands shall be conveyed or leased to the authority as above provided if such conveyance or lease would impair any covenant between the State or any county or any department or board thereof and the holders of bonds issued by the State or such county, department, or board.
