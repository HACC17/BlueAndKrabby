**[ยง206E-186] Special facility revenue bonds; special funds.** (a) A separate special fund shall be established for each special facility financed from the proceeds of the revenue bonds secured under the same trust indenture. Each fund shall be designated "special facility revenue bond special fund" and shall bear additional designation as the authority deems appropriate to properly identify the fund.

(b) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, including particularly section 206E-16, all revenues, income, and receipts derived from the special facility for which the revenue bonds are issued shall be paid into the special facility revenue bond fund established for that special facility and applied as provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds.
