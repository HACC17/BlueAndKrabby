**[§206E-196] Assessment for operating costs.** (a) The authority shall have the power to assess all land users, except the federal government, for their fair share of the costs required to administer and operate the Kalaeloa community development district, which may include costs associated with staffing. Assessments shall be based on each landowner's proportionate share of the total acreage of the Kalaeloa community development district.

(b) The assessment shall be set by the authority annually, based upon the operating budget for the district, and adjusted for any actual expenditures made in the prior year in excess of the prior approved budget. The assessments shall be paid to the authority in semiannual payments commencing thirty days after the beginning of the fiscal year.

(c) The authority may charge interest or other fees on assessment amounts not paid on a timely basis, and may withhold services or approval of governmental permits for land users delinquent in payments.

(d) For the purposes of this section, "land user" includes the owner of land; provided that the landowner may assign the responsibility for payment of assessments to the lessee or licensee of the land. [L 2002, c 184, pt of §2]
