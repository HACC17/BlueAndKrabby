**[ยง206E-10] Condemnation of real property.** The authority upon making a finding that it is necessary to acquire any real property for its immediate or future use for the purposes of this chapter, may acquire the property by condemnation pursuant to chapter 101, including property already devoted to a public use. Such property shall not thereafter be taken for any other public use without the consent of the authority. No award of compensation shall be increased by reason of any increase in the value of real property caused by the designation of a community development district or plan adopted pursuant to a designation, or the actual or proposed acquisition, use or disposition of any other real property by the authority.
