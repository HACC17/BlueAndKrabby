G. Homebuyers' Club Program

**[ยง201H-171] Homebuyers' club program.** (a) The corporation may establish a homebuyers' club program for participants who are desirous of purchasing a home and who have adequate incomes but who lack sufficient funds for the downpayment and closing costs. The primary focus of this program is to facilitate the purchase of homes by providing participants with strategies to save money, to resolve credit problems, and to educate participants on how to shop for and purchase a home.

(b) In establishing such a program, the corporation shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 relating to establishing a savings program for participants based upon individual analyses of income and family expenses. The rules may also provide for integration of the homebuyers' club program with other governmental programs including but not limited to individual housing accounts under section 235-5.5, the state mortgage guarantee program under subpart E, the downpayment loan program established under subpart F, and the rent-to-own program established under subpart H.

(c) The corporation may secure the services of another public or private entity to carry out the purposes of this section. [L 2006, c 180, pt of ยง4]
