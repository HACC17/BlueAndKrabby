**[ยง201H-43] Interim financing of projects.** (a) The corporation may provide interim construction loans to eligible developers. In addition to the rate of interest charged on interim loans, the corporation may charge loan commitment fees to be determined by rules adopted by the corporation.

(b) The interim loans shall be secured by a duly recorded primary or secondary mortgage upon the fee simple or leasehold interest in the land upon which the dwelling units are constructed, or the corporation may require other security interests and instruments as it deems necessary to secure the indebtedness and such other conditions consistent with the production and marketing of dwelling units at the lowest possible prices. The corporation may also set the conditions of a loan in a building and loan agreement between the eligible developer and the corporation to secure the loan and the performance of the developer to complete the project.
