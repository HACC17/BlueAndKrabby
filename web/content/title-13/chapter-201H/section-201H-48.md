(B) Is a person whose spouse or a household member does not own a majority interest in fee simple or leasehold lands suitable for dwelling purposes, or a majority interest in lands under any trust agreement or other fiduciary arrangement in which another person holds the legal title to the land, except when husband and wife are living apart under a decree of separation from bed and board issued by the family court pursuant to section 580-71\.
