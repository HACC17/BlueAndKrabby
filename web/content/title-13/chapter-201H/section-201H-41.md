**[ยง201H-41] Independent development of projects.** (a) In any county, the corporation may develop or may enter into agreements to develop housing projects with an eligible developer if in the corporation's reasonable judgment a project is primarily designed for lower income housing. The agreement may provide for the housing to be placed under the control of the corporation, or to be sold by the corporation, or to be sold to the corporation as soon as the units are completed and shall contain terms, conditions, and covenants as the corporation, by rules, deems appropriate. Every agreement shall provide for the developer to furnish a performance bond in favor of the corporation, assuring the timely and complete performance of the housing project. Sureties on the bond shall be satisfactory to the corporation.

(b) The plans and specifications for the housing project shall:

(1) Provide for economically integrated housing by stipulation and design;

(2) Provide for the sale of all dwelling units in fee simple or in leasehold either to the corporation or to the purchaser and in all cases subject to all of the provisions of sections 201H-47, 201H-49, and 201H-50 excepting units sold at market price; and

(3) Encompass the use of lands adequately suited to the size, design, and types of occupancies designated in subsection (a), properly located for occupancy by the group for which the project was primarily designed, properly districted for the use intended prior to the agreement, and appropriately zoned within an urban land use district or appropriate in its situation and surroundings for more intensive or denser zoning.

(c) The corporation may accept and approve housing projects independently initiated by private developers that fully comply with subsections (a) and (b). The corporation may review the plans, specifications, districting, and zoning of the project for the purpose of exempting the project from all statutes, ordinances, charter provisions, and rules of any government agency relating to zoning and construction standards for subdivisions, development, and improvement of land and the construction, improvement, and sale of dwelling units thereon; provided that the procedures in section 201H-38(a)(1), (2), and (3) have been satisfied.
