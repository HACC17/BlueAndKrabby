**[§211F-9] Meetings of the board.** (a) The meetings of the board shall be open to the public as provided in section 92-3, except that when it is necessary for the board to receive information that is proprietary to a particular enterprise the disclosure of which might be harmful to the business interests of the enterprise, the board may enter into an executive meeting that is closed to the public.

(b) The board shall be subject to the procedural requirements of section 92-4; provided that this authorization to hold closed meetings in accordance with subsection (a) shall be in addition to the exceptions listed in section 92-5, to enable the corporation to respect the proprietary requirements of enterprises with which it has business dealings.
