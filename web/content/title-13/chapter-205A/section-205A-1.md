Case Notes

In the definition of "shoreline", the "upper reaches of the wash of the waves" is the highest reach of the highest wash of the waves in non-storm or tidal conditions, "usually evidenced by the edge of vegetation growth"; merely because artificially planted vegetation survives more than one year does not deem it "naturally rooted and growing" such that it can be used to determine the shoreline. 112 H. 161, 145 P.3d 704 (2006).
