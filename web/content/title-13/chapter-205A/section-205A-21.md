**PART II. SPECIAL MANAGEMENT AREAS**

Note

Part heading amended by L 1979, c 200, ยง6.

**ยง205A-21 Findings and purposes.** The legislature finds that, special controls on developments within an area along the shoreline are necessary to avoid permanent losses of valuable resources and the foreclosure of management options, and to ensure that adequate access, by dedication or other means, to public owned or used beaches, recreation areas, and natural reserves is provided. The legislature finds and declares that it is the state policy to preserve, protect, and where possible, to restore the natural resources of the coastal zone of Hawaii.
