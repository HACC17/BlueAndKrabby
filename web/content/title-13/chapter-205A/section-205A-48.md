Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to diminish the jurisdiction of the state department of transportation over wharves, airports, docks, piers, or other commercial harbors, and any other maritime facilities constructed by the State; provided that such plans are submitted for the review and information of the officer of the respective agency charged with the administration of the county zoning laws, and found not to conflict with any county ordinances, zoning laws, and building codes.
