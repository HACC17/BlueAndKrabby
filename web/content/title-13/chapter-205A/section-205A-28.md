Case Notes

Where developer's proposed subdivision fell within the definition of "development" found in ยง205A-22, trial court correctly determined that a special management area use permit was required. 109 H. 384, 126 P.3d 1071 (2006).

Where the city council did not delegate the power to determine the effects on archeological resources and the means to protect the resources to a private petitioner, and conditioned the issuance of any development permit for the rail project on its receipt of documentation that a programmatic agreement to minimize and mitigate adverse effects on historic properties as generally described in the final environmental impact statement had been executed, the city and State gave full consideration to cultural and historic values as required under this chapter. 128 H. 53, 283 P.3d 60 (2012).
