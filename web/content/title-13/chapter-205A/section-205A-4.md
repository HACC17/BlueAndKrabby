**ยง205A-4 Implementation of objectives, policies, and guidelines.** (a) In implementing the objectives of the coastal zone management program, the agencies shall give full consideration to ecological, cultural, historic, esthetic, recreational, scenic, and open space values, and coastal hazards, as well as to needs for economic development.

(b) The objectives and policies of this chapter and any guidelines enacted by the legislature shall be binding upon actions within the coastal zone management area by all agencies, within the scope of their authority. [L 1977, c 188, pt of ยง3; am L 1979, c 200, ยง3; am L 1989, c 356, ยง6]

Case Notes

Plaintiff's claim that the county defendants failed to consider cultural and historic values in violation of the coastal zone management act was not dependent on the determination of the access point to the development and, thus, was ripe. 131 H. 123, 315 P.3d 749 (2013).
