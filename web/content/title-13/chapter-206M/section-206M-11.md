**§206M-11 Special purpose revenue bonds not a general or moral obligation of State.** No holder or holders of special purpose revenue bonds issued under this chapter shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the State to pay the bonds or the interest thereon and no moneys other than the revenues pledged to the bonds shall be applied to the payment thereof. Each special purpose revenue bond issued under this chapter shall recite in substance that the bond, including interest thereon, is not a general or moral obligation of the State and is payable solely from the revenues pledged to the payment thereof, and that the bond is not secured, directly or indirectly, by the full faith and credit or the general credit of the State or by revenues or taxes of the State other than the revenues specifically pledged thereto. [L 1983, c 152, pt of §2; am L 2000, c 72, §15]
