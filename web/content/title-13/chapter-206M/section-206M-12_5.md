**[ยง206M-12.5] Federal tax-exempt status.** Special purpose revenue bonds issued pursuant to this chapter, to the extent practicable, shall be issued to comply with requirements imposed by applicable federal law providing that the interest on the special purpose revenue bonds shall be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes (except as certain minimum taxes, environmental taxes, or other federal taxes or tax consequences may apply). The development corporation may enter into agreements, establish funds or accounts, and take any action required to comply with applicable federal law. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prohibit the issuance of special purpose revenue bonds, the interest on which may be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes.
