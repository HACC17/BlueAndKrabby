**§201M-3 Small business statement after public hearing.** (a) For any proposed rule that affects small business, the agency shall also submit a small business statement to the small business regulatory review board and the departmental advisory committee on small business after the public hearing is held. This section shall not apply to emergency rules. The small business statement required by this section shall provide the following information:

(1) A description of how opinions or comments from affected small business were solicited, a summary of the public and small business comments, and a summary of the agency's response to those com­ments;

(2) The number of persons who:

(A) Attended the public hearing;

(B) Testified at the hearing; and

(C) Submitted written comments; and

(3) If there was a request to change the proposed rule at the hearing in a way that affected small business, a statement of the reasons for adopting the proposed rule, the reason why a requested change was not made, and the problems or negative result the change would provide if adopted.

(b) If the small business regulatory review board finds that a statement provided pursuant to subsection (a)(3):

(1) Indicates inconsistency with any of the agency's determinations under section 201M-2(b); or

(2) Does not address the concerns of public input,

the board with good cause may request a written response from the agency explaining the rationale used to deny the public concerns within ten working days of receipt of the small business statement after public hearing. The agency shall respond in writing to the board's concerns within ten working days.

(c) The written response from an agency required in subsection (b), at a minimum, shall:

(1) Specifically address each issue and concern raised in the board's request for a written response; and

(2) Affirmatively state that the agency has considered all written and oral testimony received at the agency's public hearing and has addressed all issues or concerns raised in the written and oral testimony. [L 1998, c 168, pt of §2, §5; am L 2002, c 202, §5; am L 2012, c 241, §2]
