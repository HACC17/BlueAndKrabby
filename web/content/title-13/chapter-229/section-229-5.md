**[ยง229-5]** **Dissolving sister-state relationships**. The Hawaii sister-state committee may make a recommendation to terminate a sister-state relationship it deems to be defunct, moribund, or not beneficial and forward its recommendation to the legislature. The legislature, if it so chooses, shall implement the recommendation to terminate a sister-state relationship either by adopting a concurrent resolution or by enacting session law to that effect. [L 2006, c 150, pt of ยง2]
