**[ยง201-12] State program for energy planning and conservation.** The department shall develop a state program for energy planning and conservation. The program shall consist of short and long-range planning for the development and promulgation of methods to encourage voluntary conservation of gasoline, diesel oil, natural gas, propane, heating oils, other fuels, and electrical energy, and efficient development of new or alternative sources of such fuels and energy. The information resulting from such methods is to be disseminated to the people of Hawaii through all forms of mass communication media, public and private schools, private and civic organizations, and all other appropriate means. Public information offices of other state and county agencies may be called upon for assistance in the development of such program. [L 1974, c 240, ยง2]
