If any member, officer, or employee has or acquires an interest, by gift, devise, or inheritance, direct or indirect, in any development project or in any property included or planned to be included in any development project, the member, officer, or employee shall immediately disclose the same in writing to the board and the disclosure shall be entered upon the minutes of the board; and the member, officer, or employee shall dispose of the interest within six months of the acquisition or initiation of the project, whichever shall last occur. The member, officer, or employee shall not participate in any action by the board relating to the property, project, or contract in which the member, officer, or employee has or acquires any interest.
