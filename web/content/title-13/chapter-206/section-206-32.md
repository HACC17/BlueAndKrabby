**§206-32 Subordination of mortgage to agreement with government.** The board of land and natural resources may agree in any mortgage made by it that the mortgage shall be subordinate to a contract for the supervision by a government of the operation and maintenance of the mortgaged property and the construction of improvements thereon. In that event, any purchaser or purchasers at a sale of the property of the board pursuant to a foreclosure of the mortgage or any other remedy in connection therewith, shall obtain title to the contract.
