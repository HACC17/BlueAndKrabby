**§206-15 Hearings, witnesses, etc.** The board of land and natural resources may hold hearings for the purpose of receiving evidence and, in addition, may exercise all the powers set forth in section 92-16\. All these hearings shall be public. The board may require such agencies, boards, or commissions as are charged with the duty of making investigations and studies of land and land uses to investigate and study such areas as it may designate and, if investigations and studies have been made, to present findings and recommendations with regard to such areas which the board may consider as possible development areas. Any of the investigations or examinations provided for in this chapter may be conducted by the board or by a committee appointed by it, or by counsel, or by an officer or employee specially authorized by the board to conduct the investigation or examination. Any committee counsel for the board, or any person designated by it to conduct an investigation or examination may administer oaths, take affidavits, and issue subpoenas or commissions.
