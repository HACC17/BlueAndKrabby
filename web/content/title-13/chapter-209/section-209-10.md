**[ยง209-10] Agricultural water systems; emergency power.** When the governor has declared that a disaster has occurred for any portion of the State, pursuant to section 209-2, which results in damage to an agricultural water system that necessitates the temporary use of electrical power or backup generators to pump ground water for irrigation until the system can be repaired, the person who controls, operates, or manages the system may negotiate an agreement for the production of emergency power for the agricultural water system. The agreement shall terminate when the governor determines that the disaster emergency relief period is terminated.

If the negotiated agreement is with an independent power producer that is not currently regulated by the public utilities commission, the execution of the agreement shall not cause the independent power producer to become subject to the jurisdiction of the public utilities commission. [L 2008, c 97, ยง2]
