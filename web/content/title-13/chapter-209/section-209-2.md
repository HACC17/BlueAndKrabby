**ยง209-2 Governor's determination.** After the occurrence of any sudden and extraordinary event which causes losses and suffering, the governor shall make a determination as to whether a state disaster has occurred and thereafter may declare a state disaster for the entire State or any portion thereof. In making this determination the governor shall consider whether the effect on the health and living standards of a substantial number of persons and the effect on the economy of the State are of such a nature, as to warrant assistance from the state government.

The governor may in the proclamation designate the whole or any part of the State eligible for the relief provided for in this chapter and unless otherwise provided herein may authorize any or all of the relief measures provided for in parts II, III, and IV of this chapter.
