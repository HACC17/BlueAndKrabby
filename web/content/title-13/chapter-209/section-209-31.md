**§209-31 Security for loans.** Security for any loan when not available is not required, however, whenever property other than personal property and inventory, is purchased with the loan funds, a mortgage or pledge of such property shall be required as security for the loan. The director of business, economic development, and tourism may, in the director's discretion, permit the mortgage or pledge to be subordinated to the lien of a financial institution or government lending agency in the event the subordination should become necessary for the borrower to secure additional funds.
