(b) The legislature, upon a finding of overriding statewide concern, may determine in any given instance that the site for a specific project may be other than that designated in the county general plan; provided that any proposed facility or project contained in a county general plan shall not require the actual development or implementation of that facility or project or its inclusion in any state functional plan by any state agency. The implementation of functional plans shall conform to existing laws, rules, standards, and this chapter.
