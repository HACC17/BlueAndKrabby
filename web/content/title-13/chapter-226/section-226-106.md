**ยง226-106 Affordable housing.** Priority guidelines for the provision of affordable housing:

(1) Seek to use marginal or nonessential agricultural land and public land to meet housing needs of low- and moderate-income and gap-group households.

(2) Encourage the use of alternative construction and development methods as a means of reducing production costs.

(3) Improve information and analysis relative to land availability and suitability for housing.

(4) Create incentives for development which would increase home ownership and rental opportunities for Hawaii's low- and moderate-income households, gap-group households, and residents with special needs.

(5) Encourage continued support for government or private housing programs that provide low interest mortgages to Hawaii's people for the purchase of initial owner- occupied housing.

(6) Encourage public and private sector cooperation in the development of rental housing alternatives.

(7) Encourage improved coordination between various agencies and levels of government to deal with housing policies and regulations.

(8) Give higher priority to the provision of quality housing that is affordable for Hawaii's residents and less priority to development of housing intended primarily for individuals outside of Hawaii. [L 1986, c 276, ยง33; am L 1989, c 250, ยง3]
