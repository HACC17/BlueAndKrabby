**ยง225M-4 Allocation of funds.** Any of the agencies of the State to which general or special appropriations are made, or a part of whose budget contains an allocation, or which makes an allocation of funds for planning and research, shall consult with the office of planning to ensure that all expenditures are in accordance with, or in furtherance of the goals and objectives of the Hawaii State Plan. After first consulting with the director of business, economic development, and tourism, the governor may withhold the expenditure of these funds by any agency until the governor is satisfied that the expenditures will implement those goals and objectives.
