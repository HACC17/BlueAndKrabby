Case Notes

In the circumstances of the case, article XI, §9 of the Hawaii constitution created a private right of action to enforce chapter 205, and the legislature confirmed the existence of that right of action by enacting §607-25, which allows for the recovery of attorneys' fees in such actions; chapter 205 is a law relating to environmental quality within the meaning of article XI, §9, §9 is self-executing, and this section imposes "reasonable limitations and regulations" that were applicable to the case which allowed the private right of action to enforce chapter 205\. 123 H. 391, 235 P.3d 1103 (2010).
