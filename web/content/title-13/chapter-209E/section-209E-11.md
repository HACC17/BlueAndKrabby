Attorney General Opinions

Qualified businesses located in new enterprise zone (EZ) would be eligible for state tax incentives for seven-year period set forth in §209E-10(a) and this section, although a portion of that seven-year period extended beyond new EZ's five-year sunset date. Att. Gen. Op. 98-1.
