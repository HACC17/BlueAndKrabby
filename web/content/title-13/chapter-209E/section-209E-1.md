**§209E-1 Purpose.** It is declared that the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this State are dependent upon the continual encouragement, development, growth, and expansion of the private sector, and that there are certain areas in the State that need the particular attention of government to help attract private sector investment. Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to stimulate business, agricultural, and industrial growth in areas that would result in neighborhood revitalization of those areas by means of regulatory flexibility and tax incentives.
