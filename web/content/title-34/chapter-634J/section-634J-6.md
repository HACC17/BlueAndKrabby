**[ยง634J-6] Motion as stay of proceedings.** When a motion pursuant to section 634J-2 is filed prior to trial, the litigation is stayed, and the moving defendant need not plead until ten days after the motion shall have been denied, or if granted, until ten days after the required security has been furnished and the moving defendant has been given written notice. When a motion pursuant to section 634J-2 is made at any time thereafter, the litigation shall be stayed for such period after the denial of the motion or the furnishing of the required security as the court shall determine.
