**ยง636C-3 Filing and status of foreign judgments.** A copy of any exemplified foreign judgment may be filed in the office of the clerk of the appropriate court of this State. The clerk shall treat the foreign judgment in the same manner as a judgment of a court of this State. A judgment so filed has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying as a judgment of a court of this State, including establishing a lien, and may be enforced or satisfied in like manner.
