(b) The chief election officer shall be responsible for the maximization of registration of eligible electors throughout the State.

The chief election officer, in carrying out this function, may make surveys, carry on house-to-house canvassing, and assist or direct the clerk in any other area of registration.

(c) The chief election officer shall maintain data concerning registered voters, elections, apportionment, and districting. The chief election officer shall use this data to assist the reapportionment commission provided for under Article IV of the Constitution.

(d) The chief election officer shall be responsible for public education with respect to voter registration and information.

(e) The chief election officer shall adopt rules governing elections in accordance with chapter 91\.
