**[ยง11-118.5] Constitutional amendments, proposed.** Any constitutional amendment proposed by the legislature shall include in final form the exact constitutional ratification question to be printed on a ballot. The constitutional ratification question shall be phrased in a manner to enable voters to express their choice on the constitutional amendment by providing a "yes" or "no" response. The language and meaning of a constitutional amendment shall be clear and it shall be neither misleading nor deceptive. [L 1996, c 173, ยง1; am L 1997, c 2, ยง17]
