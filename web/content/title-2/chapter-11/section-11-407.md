**[ยง****11-407] Contested case hearing.** (a) A contested case hearing shall be conducted pursuant to chapter 91 and any rules adopted by the commission, except as provided in this section.

(b) If a hearing is held before the commission, the commission shall not be bound by strict rules of evidence when conducting a hearing to determine whether a violation of this part has occurred, and the degree or quantum of proof required shall be a preponderance of the evidence.

(c) The commission or hearings officer, if there is no dispute as to the facts involved in a particular matter, may permit the parties to proceed by memoranda of law in lieu of a hearing unless the procedure would unduly burden any party or is otherwise not conducive to the ends of justice.

(d) A record shall be made of the proceeding.

(e) All parties shall be afforded full opportunity to present evidence and argument on all issues involved.

(f) Any person who appears before the commission shall have all of the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of a witness appearing before the courts of this State. All witnesses summoned before the commission or hearings officer shall receive reimbursements as paid in like circumstances in the courts of this State. Any person whose name is mentioned during a proceeding before the commission and who may be adversely affected thereby may appear or file a written statement for incorporation into the record of the proceeding.

(g) If a hearing is held before a hearings officer, the hearings officer shall render a recommended decision for the commission's consideration. Any party adversely affected by the decision may file written exceptions with the commission within fifteen days after receipt of a copy of the decision by certified mail.

(h) The commission, as expeditiously as possible after the close of the commission's hearing, shall issue its final determination of violation together with separate findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding whether a violation of this part has been committed. [L 2010, c 211, pt of ยง2]
