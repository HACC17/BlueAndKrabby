The financing by any person of the dissemination, distribution, or republication, in whole or in part, of any broadcast or any written or other campaign materials prepared by the candidate, candidate committee, or agents shall be considered to be a contribution to the candidate.

This subsection shall not apply to candidates for governor or lieutenant governor supporting a co-candidate in the general election.

(b) "Coordinated activity" means:

(1) The payment by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, at the request of, or pursuant to, any general or particular understanding with a candidate, candidate committee, the party of a candidate, or an agent of a candidate, candidate committee, or the party of a candidate;

(2) The payment by any person for the production, dissemination, distribution, or republication of any written, graphic, or other form of campaign material, in whole or in part, prepared by a candidate, candidate committee, or noncandidate committee, or an agent of a candidate, candidate committee, or noncandidate committee; or

(3) Any payment by any person or contract for any electioneering communication, as defined in section 11-341, where the payment is coordinated with a candidate, candidate committee, the party of the candidate, or an agent of a candidate, candidate committee, or the party of the candidate.

(c) No expenditure for a candidate who files an affidavit with the commission agreeing to limit aggregate expenditures by the candidate, including coordinated activity by any person, shall be made or incurred by a candidate committee or noncandidate committee without authorization of the candidate or the candidate's authorized representative. Every expenditure so authorized and made or incurred shall be attributed to the candidate with whom the candidate committee or noncandidate committee is directly associated for the purpose of imposing the expenditure limitations set forth in section 11-423\.
