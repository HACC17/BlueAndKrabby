**PART V. PARTIES**

Case Notes

State's prohibition on write-in voting, as part of electoral scheme providing constitutionally sufficient ballot access, does not impose unconstitutional burden on voters' rights under First and Fourteenth Amendments. 504 U.S. 428.

**§11-61 "Political party" defined.** (a) The term "political party" means any party which has qualified as a political party under sections 11-62 and 11-64 and has not been disqualified by this section. A political party shall be an association of voters united for the purpose of promoting a common political end or carrying out a particular line of political policy and which maintains a general organization throughout the State, including a regularly constituted central committee and county committees in each county other than Kalawao.

(b) Any party which does not meet the following requirements or the requirements set forth in sections 11-62 to 11-64, shall be subject to disqualification:

(1) A party must have had candidates running for election at the last general election for any of the offices listed in paragraph (2) whose terms had expired. This does not include those offices which were vacant because the incumbent had died or resigned before the end of the incumbent's term; and

(2) The party received at least ten per cent of all votes cast:

(A) For any of the offices voted upon by all the voters in the State; or

(B) In at least fifty per cent of the congressional districts; or

(3) The party received at least four per cent of all the votes cast for all the offices of state senator statewide; or

(4) The party received at least four per cent of all the votes cast for all the offices of state representative statewide; or

(5) The party received at least two per cent of all the votes cast for all the offices of state senate and all the offices of state representative combined statewide.
