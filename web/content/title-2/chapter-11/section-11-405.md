**[ยง****11-405] Preliminary determination regarding probable cause.** (a) Upon hearing the response, if the respondent explains or otherwise responds to the complaint, and upon completion of any investigation, the commission may make a prompt preliminary determination as to whether probable cause exists that a violation of this part has been committed. The preliminary determination with findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be served upon the respondent by certified mail.

(b) The respondent shall be afforded an opportunity to contest the commission's preliminary determination of probable cause by making a request for a contested case hearing under chapter 91 within twenty days of receipt of the preliminary determination. Failure to request a contested case hearing shall render the commission's preliminary determination final. [L 2010, c 211, pt of ยง2]
