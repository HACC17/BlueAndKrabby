**[ยง****11-354] Fundraising on state or county property prohibited.** (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), no person shall solicit a contribution in a government facility that is used for the discharge of official duties by an officer or employee of the State or county.

(b) The prohibition in subsection (a) shall not apply to any government facility that permits use by nongovernmental organizations for a fee or with reservations; provided that the government facility's use rules do not prohibit political activities on the premises. Government facilities that permit use for political activities shall be available to a candidate, candidate committee, or noncandidate committee for fundraising activities pursuant to the same terms and conditions that would otherwise apply to use by nongovernmental organizations.

(c) A person who violates the prohibition of fundraising on state or county property shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. [L 2010, c 211, pt of ยง2]
