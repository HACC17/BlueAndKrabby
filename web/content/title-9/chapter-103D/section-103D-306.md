**ยง103D-306 Sole source procurement.** (a) A contract may be awarded for goods, services, or construction without competition when the head of a purchasing agency determines in writing that there is only one source for the required good, service, or construction, the determination is reviewed and approved by the chief procurement officer, the written determination is posted in the manner described in rules adopted by the policy board, and no objection is outstanding. The written determination, any objection, and a written summary of the disposition of any objection shall be included in the contract file.

(b) The written determination shall contain such information as the rules of the policy board require. Persons may file written objections to the issuance of a contract pursuant to this section. Rules of the policy board shall provide for the disposition of objections, including a written summary of the disposition.

(c) The rules of the policy board shall include a non-exhaustive list of procurements which constitute sole source procurements and criteria for determining when a particular procurement may be determined to be a sole source.
