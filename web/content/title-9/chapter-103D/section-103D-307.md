**[§103D-307] Emergency procurements.** (a) The head of a purchasing agency may obtain a good, service, or construction essential to meet an emergency by means other than specified in this chapter when the following conditions exist:

(1) A situation of an unusual or compelling urgency creates a threat to life, public health, welfare, or safety by reason of major natural disaster, epidemic, riot, fire, or such other reason as may be determined by the head of that purchasing agency;

(2) The emergency condition generates an immediate and serious need for goods, services, or construction that cannot be met through normal procurement methods and the government would be seriously injured if the purchasing agency is not permitted to employ the means it proposes to use to obtain the goods, services, or construction; and

(3) Without the needed good, service, or construction, the continued functioning of government, the preservation or protection of irreplaceable property, or the health and safety of any person will be seriously threatened.

(b) The emergency procurement shall be made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances and, where practicable, approval from the chief procurement officer shall be obtained prior to the procurement. A written determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular contractor shall be included in the contract file. [L Sp 1993, c 8, pt of §2]
