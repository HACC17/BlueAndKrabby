**[ยง103D-706] Remedies prior to an award.** If prior to award it is determined that a solicitation or proposed award of a contract is in violation of law, then the solicitation or proposed award shall be:

(1) Canceled; or

(2) Revised to comply with the law. [L Sp 1993, c 8, pt of ยง2]

Case Notes

Term "revise" includes remand and reconsideration; where cancellation of solicitation was contrary to purposes underlying procurement code, hearings officer's selection of cancellation of solicitation was abuse of discretion. 87 H. 147, 952 P.2d 1210.
