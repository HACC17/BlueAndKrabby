**ยง103D-1003 Printing, binding, and stationery work.** (a) All bids submitted for a printing, binding, or stationery section 103D-302 contract in which all work will be performed in-state, including all preparatory work, presswork, bindery work, and any other production-related work, to include storage and shipping costs, shall receive a fifteen per cent preference for purposes of bid evaluation.

(b) Where bids are for work performed in-state and out-of-state, then for the purpose of selecting the lowest bid submitted only, the amount bid for work performed out-of-state shall be increased by fifteen per cent. The lowest total bid, taking the preference into consideration, shall be awarded the contract unless the solicitation provides for additional award criteria. The contract amount awarded, however, shall be the amount of the price offered, exclusive of the preference. [L 1994, c 186, pt of ยง1; am L 1997, c 352, ยง17; am L 1999, c 149, ยง19]
