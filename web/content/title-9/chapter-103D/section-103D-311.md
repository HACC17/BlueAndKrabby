**ยง103D-311 Prequalification of suppliers.** (a) The policy board may adopt rules to prequalify prospective suppliers for particular types of goods, services, and construction or to limit a solicitation to prequalified vendors to meet statutory or licensing requirements applying to the solicitation or when the time necessary to verify vendor qualifications would jeopardize timely award of contracts.

(b) A prospective supplier may be prequalified for a particular type of goods or services. Solicitation mailing lists of potential contractors shall include, but shall not be limited to, prequalified suppliers. [L Sp 1993, c 8, pt of ยง2; am L 1997, c 352, ยง23]
