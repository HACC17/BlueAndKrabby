**[ยง103D-326] Fiscal responsibility.** Every contract modification, change order, or contract price adjustment under a contract shall be subject to prior written certification by the appropriate fiscal officer for funding the project or the contract, as to the effect of the contract modification, change order, or adjustment in contract price on the total project budget or the total contract budget. In the event that the certification of the fiscal officer discloses a resulting increase in the total project budget or the total contract budget, the procurement officer shall not execute or make such contract modification, change order, or adjustment in contract price unless sufficient funds are available therefor, or the scope of the project or contract is adjusted so as to permit the degree of completion that is feasible within the total project budget or total contract budget as it existed prior to the contract modification, change order, or adjustment in contract price under consideration; provided, that with respect to the validity, as to the contractor, of any executed contract modification, change order, or adjustment in contract price which the contractor has reasonably relied upon, it shall be presumed that there has been compliance with this section. [L Sp 1993, c 8, pt of ยง2]
