**[ยง113-4] Proceeding by owner.** Where an inverse condemnation proceeding is instituted by the owner of any right, title or interest in real property because of use of the owner's property in any program or project in which federal or federal-aid funds are used, the court, rendering a judgment for the plaintiff in such proceeding and awarding compensation for the taking of property, or the State's attorney effecting a settlement of any such proceeding, shall determine and award or allow to such plaintiff, as a part of such judgment or settlement, such sums as will, in the opinion of the court or the State's attorney, reimburse such plaintiff for the plaintiff's reasonable costs, disbursements and expenses, including reasonable attorney, appraisal and engineering fees, actually incurred because of such proceeding.
