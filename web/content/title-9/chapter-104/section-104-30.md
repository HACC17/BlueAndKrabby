**ยง104-30 Application of this chapter to contracts entered into without regard to other laws.** The fact that a contract is or was entered into without regard to chapter 103D, or upon a cost-plus-a-fixed fee basis, or cost-plus-a-fixed percentage basis, or without advertising for proposals, shall not render this chapter inapplicable to the contract, if otherwise this chapter would be applicable.
