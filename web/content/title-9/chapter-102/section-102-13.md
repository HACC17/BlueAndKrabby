**ยง102-13 Amendment of contracts, when authorized.** Where there is an outstanding contract, lease, license, permit, or any other such arrangement for the operation of concessions or concession spaces on governmental property, the parties may amend the instrument to permit a related use with an increased rental adjustment where the lessee, licensee or permittee, as the case may be, can show financial hardship arising out of changes of circumstances or otherwise, if required to continue operation under the original permitted use.
