**ยง102-9 Contracts to be in writing; highest responsible bidder.** All such contracts shall be in writing, shall be executed by the officer letting the contract in the name of the State, county, or the board, bureau, or commission thereof authorized to let contracts in its own name, as the case may be, and shall be made with the highest responsible bidder, if such bidder qualifies by providing the security required by sections 102-11 and 102-12\. If the highest and best bid or any other bid is rejected, or if the bidder to whom the contract was awarded fails to enter into the contract and furnish satisfactory security, the officer may, in the officer's discretion, award the contract to the next highest and best remaining responsible bidder.
