**[ยง103F-503]** **Award of contract suspended during a protest**. In the event of a timely protest, or request for reconsideration, no further action to award the contract until the issue is resolved shall be taken, unless the chief procurement officer makes a written determination that the award of the contract without delay is necessary to protect the health, safety, or welfare of a person, as provided by rules.
