A contract for health and human services may be for any period of time and for multiple terms if the head of a purchasing agency deems it to be in the best interest of the purchasing agency to enter into an extended term or multi-term contract, provided the possibility of an extended term or multi-term contract is included in the request for proposals, if applicable, funds are available for the first fiscal period of the initial term of the contract when the contract is executed, and the contract expressly provides that extension or renewal is subject to the availability and appropriation of funds.
