(1) Before disinterring any remains, the comptroller shall hold at least one public hearing to afford the public an opportunity to review the plans to improve, redevelop, reduce the size of, or dispose of the cemetery and to submit comments and views on the proposed project; and

(2) The comptroller shall notify in writing the known relative of a deceased person whose remains are to be disinterred and relocated of the public hearing required by paragraph (1); if the relatives of the deceased are unknown the comptroller shall give at least one public notice of the public hearing statewide.
