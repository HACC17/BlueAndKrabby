(2) Follow state procurement office guidance for tracking payments and deliverables by using a contract administration worksheet that includes milestones or deliverables, which are marked off as items are completed; and

(3) To help ensure end-user satisfaction with their capital improvement projects, identify and involve stakeholders throughout a project's execution and closing, including providing information about project costs, schedules, and performance. [L 2016, c 241, ยง2]
