**[ยง341-1] Findings and purpose.** The legislature finds that the quality of the environment is as important to the welfare of the people of Hawaii as is the economy of the State. The legislature further finds that the determination of an optimum balance between economic development and environmental quality deserves the most thoughtful consideration, and that the maintenance of the optimum quality of the environment deserves the most intensive care.

The purpose of this chapter is to stimulate, expand and coordinate efforts to determine and maintain the optimum quality of the environment of the State. [L 1970, c 132, pt of ยง1]
