**[§342G-3] Goals.** (a) It is the goal of the State to reduce the solid waste stream prior to disposal by:

(1) Twenty-five per cent by January 1, 1995; and

(2) Fifty per cent by January 1, 2000;

through source reduction, recycling, and bioconversion. Where feasible, the office shall establish other state goals for specific commodities, recognizing market considerations.

(b) It is the goal of the State to reduce by not less than twenty-five per cent the amount of office paper generated by all state and county agencies by January 1, 1995, through source reduction. The base year for calculating progress toward this goal shall be total office paper consumption by state and county agencies in 1990.

(c) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict a county from setting waste reduction goals higher than those of the State. [L 1991, c 324, pt of §2]
