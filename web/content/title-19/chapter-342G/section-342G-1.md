"HDPE" means high density polyethylene plastic and containers manufactured from this material.

"Household hazardous waste" means those wastes resulting from products purchased by the general public for household use which, because of their quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics, may pose a substantial known or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated, disposed of, or otherwise managed.

"Incineration" means volume reduction by controlled burning of combustible solid waste.

"Integrated solid waste management" means the use of a variety of waste management practices and processing methods to safely and effectively manage solid waste with the least adverse impact on human health and the environment.

"Landfill" means a land site on which engineering principles are utilized to bury deposits of solid waste without creating a nuisance or hazard to public health or safety.

"Landfilling" means the permitted disposal of solid waste on land in a series of compacted layers and covering the solid waste with soil or other materials.
