**[ยง342G-44] Double-sided copying.** Double-sided copying shall be standard operating practice for all state and county agencies, offices, and facilities, as available and appropriate. To increase double-sided copying, each agency in coordination with the department of accounting and general services, each appropriate county entity, and the office, shall establish a schedule for the replacement of single-sided copying machines with double-sided copying machines for all high volume and other targeted machines that may be identified through the conduct of waste evaluations.
