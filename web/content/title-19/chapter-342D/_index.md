Case Notes

Department of health's (DOH) duties under the public trust doctrine requires the DOH to not only issue permits after prescribed measures appear to be in compliance with state regulation, but also to ensure that the prescribed measures are actually being implemented after a thorough assessment of the possible adverse impacts the development would have on the State's natural resources; this duty is consistent with the constitutional mandate under article XI, §1 of the Hawaii constitution and the duties imposed upon the DOH by this chapter and chapter 342E. 111 H. 205, 140 P.3d 985.
