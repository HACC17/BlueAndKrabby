**[ยง342D-52] Testing of water and aquatic and other life.** The director may test any water and aquatic and other life that has been subjected to an oil spill or any other form of water pollution and assess the environmental effects of the pollution, including its effects on:

(1) The quality of the receiving water; and

(2) Aquatic and other life.

If the department determines that the effects are such that it would be hazardous to consume the aquatic or other life, the department shall immediately notify the public of that hazard through the news media and by posting warning signs in the areas where the water and shoreline contain aquatic or other life that would be hazardous to consume.
