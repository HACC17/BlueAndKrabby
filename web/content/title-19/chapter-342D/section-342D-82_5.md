**[ยง342D-82.5]** **Use of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and other federal moneys**. (a) The director may provide financial assistance for publicly owned wastewater treatment works for the construction of necessary wastewater infrastructure projects, through the revolving fund, using moneys from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and other applicable federal acts.

(b) The director may establish a separate account within the revolving fund and assign to that account federal moneys appropriated under federal laws that authorize principal forgiveness, zero and negative interest loans, and grants, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and other applicable federal acts. The director may use those moneys and in so doing may include additional requirements and subsidization not applicable to the remainder of the revolving fund, including forgiveness of principal, zero and negative interest loans, and grants to publicly-owned wastewater treatment works that meet eligibility requirements for the revolving fund.

(c) The director shall certify that a project receiving financial assistance is entitled to priority over other eligible projects on the basis of water pollution and financial needs, as well as a preference to those projects that can be started and completed expeditiously as stipulated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and other applicable federal acts.

(d) Among eligible projects, the director may also give priority to projects that incorporate renewable energy, energy efficiency, and conservation measures in wastewater infrastructure, to the extent allowed by federal law.

(e) Each project receiving financial assistance shall be in conformance with the conditions for water pollution control financing under section 342D-87(a)(1), (2), (4), and (5), and (b). [L 2009, c 98, ยง3]
