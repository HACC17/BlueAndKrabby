**ยง342L-5 Variances allowed.** Provisions under this chapter deemed more stringent than the federal rules established under Subtitle I of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as added by the federal Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, may be varied by the department, when the variance results in an equivalent degree of human health and environmental protection and does not present a greater danger to human health or the environment.
