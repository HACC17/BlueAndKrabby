**[ยง334-102] Criteria.** The director shall use the following as criteria in determining the eligibility of each applicant:

(1) Facilities:

(A) Settings, whether residential or day, shall be as close to a normal home environment as possible without sacrificing client safety or care;

(B) Residential treatment centers shall be relatively small, preferably fifteen beds or less, but in any case with the appearance of noninstitutional setting; and

(C) The individual elements of the system, where possible, shall be in separate facilities and not part of one large facility attempting to serve an entire range of clients;

(2) Staffing patterns:

(A) Staffing patterns shall reflect, to the maximum extent feasible, at all levels, the cultural, linguistic, ethnic, sexual, and other social characteristics of the community the facility serves;

(B) The programs shall be designed to use appropriate multidisciplinary professional consultation and staff to meet the specific diagnostic and treatment needs of the client; and

(C) Programs shall be encouraged to use paraprofessionals where appropriate;

(3) Programs:

(A) The programs shall have a rehabilitation focus which encourages the client to develop the skills to become self-sufficient and capable of increasing levels of independent functioning where appropriate. They shall include prevocational and vocational programs;

(B) The programs shall encourage the participation of the clients in the daily operation of the setting in development of treatment and rehabilitation planning and evaluation;

(C) Participation in any element of the system shall not preclude the involvement of clients in individual therapy. Individual therapists of clients, where possible, shall be directly involved in the development and implementation of a treatment plan;

(4) Coordination: The programs shall demonstrate specific linkages with one another, and with the general treatment and social service system, as a whole. These connections should not be limited to the mental health system, but shall include, whenever possible, community resources utilized by the general population. To ensure coordination occurs, each program shall include a case management system in which the case manager serves as a coordinator to assure the cooperative operation of the various elements of the system and to act as an active advocate for the clients in the system. The case manager shall assure that each client receives the appropriate type of service. The case manager shall meet regularly with clients, work closely with program staff, and serve as an advocate. The case manager shall work directly with the client and the system to assure continuity of care between the service elements of the system. [L 1980, c 221, pt of ยง2]
