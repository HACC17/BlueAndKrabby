**[ยง334-145] Treatment costs, fees, and costs for petition process.** The petitioner shall bear all fees and costs related to bringing the petition. The petitioner or respondent shall bear all costs of private treatment. Nothing in this part authorizes publicly funded substance abuse treatment. However, if the respondent is eligible to receive publicly funded treatment and such a program is available for the respondent, the court may order the treatment in such a program. [L 2004, c 44, pt of ยง20]
