(1) Service of process and papers relating to the involuntary hospitalization of the patient shall be made directly and personally upon the patient and shall also be made personally or by certified mail upon the patients guardians and the public defender, the patients attorney or court-appointed attorney; otherwise, service upon the patient shall be incomplete. A copy of the legal process or paper served on a patient under this paragraph shall be given to the administrator of the psychiatric facility or the administrators deputy and shall be filed with the records of the patient.

A legal process or paper served under this paragraph shall be filed with the records of the patient, and the administrator of the psychiatric facility or the administrators deputy shall immediately inform the court or other agency out of which the process or paper issued, in writing, of the date of service and of the mental and physical condition of the patient.
