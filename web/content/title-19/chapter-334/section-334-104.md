**[ยง334-104] Least restrictive level of service.** The system shall be developed in such a way that clients may move within the system to the most appropriate, least restrictive level of service. The system shall also allow for direct referral of clients, without requiring that a person pass through the entire system to reach the most appropriate level. [L 1980, c 221, pt of ยง2]
