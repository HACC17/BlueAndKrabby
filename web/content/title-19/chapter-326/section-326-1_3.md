**[ยง326-1.3] Liberty, autonomy, and dignity of patient residents.** (a) In recognition of the disruptions and hardships experienced over the course of their lives by former Hansen's disease patients residing at Kalaupapa, the legislature declares its intent to ensure that all residents at Kalaupapa are treated with dignity, respect, courtesy, and sensitivity and that the protections extended by this chapter to the patient residents at Kalaupapa are honored and upheld by the department of health to the extent possible within their purview.

(b) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the department of health shall promote and protect the personal liberty, autonomy, and dignity of all patient residents at Kalaupapa. [L 2005, c 37, ยง1]
