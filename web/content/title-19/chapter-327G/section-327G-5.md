**[ยง327G-5] Authority and duty of agent; limitations on liability.** (a) The authority of an agent becomes effective only upon a determination that the principal lacks capacity and ceases to be effective upon a determination made under section 327G-7 that the principal has recovered capacity, unless otherwise specified in the advance mental health care directive.

(b) An agent has the authority to make any and all mental health care decisions on behalf of the principal while the principal lacks capacity, unless otherwise specified or limited in the advance mental health care directive.

(c) In exercising authority, an agent has a duty to act consistently with the provisions of the advance mental health care directive. An agent shall make all mental health care decisions in accordance with the principal's preferences or instructions expressed in the advance mental health care directive, if any, and the principal's other wishes to the extent known to the agent. If the principal's preferences, instructions, and wishes are not expressed or known, the agent shall make the decision in accordance with the agent's good faith determination of the principal's best interests. In determining the principal's best interests, the agent shall consider the principal's personal values to the extent known to the agent.

(d) An agent has the same right as the principal to receive information regarding the proposed mental health treatment and to receive, review, and consent to disclosure of medical records relating to that treatment, unless limited by the advance mental health care directive or any federal law. This right of access and disclosure does not waive any evidentiary privilege.

(e) A mental health care decision made by an agent for a principal shall be effective without judicial approval.

(f) An agent is not, solely as a result of acting in that capacity, personally liable for the cost of treatment provided to the principal.

(g) An agent whose decisions regarding the principal are made in good faith, pursuant to the provisions of the advance mental health care directive, shall not be subject to criminal prosecution, civil liability, or professional disciplinary action with respect to those decisions.
