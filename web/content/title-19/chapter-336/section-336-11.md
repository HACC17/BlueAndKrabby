**PART II. PATIENTS WITH CERTAIN CHRONIC DISEASES**

**§336-11 Payment of transportation costs; agreements for continued care; funds.** The director of health may in the director's discretion authorize the payment of the cost of transportation of aliens and other nonresident persons who have become public charges by reason of their hospitalization for Hansen's disease, tuberculosis, or other chronic diseases requiring prolonged hospitalization, from the State to the place where the persons have their legal residence. For the purpose of facilitating the return of such persons to the place of their residence or to facilitate the return to the State of any person similarly situated, the department of health may enter into agreements with any state of the United States or any foreign country. The department may also enter into any agreement to provide for the continued care of the aliens or nonresidents of the State, at the expense of the state or foreign country or to provide for reciprocal treatment of residents of the State by such state or foreign country.

The department may receive funds by way of grant, gift, or otherwise from any state, the United States, or any foreign country or any person for the purpose of paying all or a part of the cost of such transportation or care.
