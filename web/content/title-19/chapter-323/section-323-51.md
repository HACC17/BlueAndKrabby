**[PART IV. THERAPY]**

**[ยง323-51] Animal therapy.** Animals of the kind commonly kept as household pets may be brought into long term health care facilities for the purpose of visiting patients therein. The institution shall determine whether an animal is suitable for visitation, the location where the visit may take place, and the policies governing the visit. At the discretion of the institution, the animal owner may be required to produce written documentation from a veterinarian attesting to the animal's good health, before visitation is permitted. [L 1985, c 290, ยง2]
