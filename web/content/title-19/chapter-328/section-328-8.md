**§328-8 Regulations to be prescribed.** (a) Whenever in the judgment of the department of health such action will promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers, the department shall prescribe regulations fixing and establishing for any food or class of food a reasonable definition and standard of identity, or reasonable standard of quality or fill of container. In prescribing a definition and standard of identity for any food or class of food in which optional ingredients are permitted, the department shall, for the purpose of promoting honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers, designate the optional ingredients which shall be named on the label. The definitions and standards so prescribed shall conform so far as practicable to the definitions and standards promulgated under authority of the Federal Act.

(b) Temporary permits now or hereafter granted for interstate shipment of experimental packs of food varying from the requirements of federal definitions and standards of identity are automatically effective in this State under the conditions provided in such permits. In addition, the director may issue additional permits where they are necessary to the completion or conclusiveness of an otherwise adequate investigation and where the interests of consumers are safeguarded. Such permits shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the director may prescribe.

(c) The director may establish rules as necessary for the enforcement of this part. The rules shall be adopted pursuant to chapter 91; except that the director may, without regard to chapter 91, establish tolerance levels and regulatory or action levels by reference to the provisions of the regulations or guidelines of the United States established in 40 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 180 and 185 or the United States Food and Drug Administration Compliance Policy Guides as the regulations or guidelines become effective at any time or from time to time.
