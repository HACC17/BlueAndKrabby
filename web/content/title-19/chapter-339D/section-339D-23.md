(b) By June 1, 2010, and annually thereafter, each television manufacturer shall submit a plan to the department to establish, conduct, and manage a program for the recycling of covered televisions sold in the State, which shall be subject to the following conditions:

(1) The plan shall not permit the charging of a fee at the point of recycling if the covered television is brought by the covered television owner to a central location for recycling; provided that the plan may include a reasonable transportation fee if the television manufacturer or television manufacturer's agent removes the covered electronic device from the owner's premises at the owner's request and if the removal is not in conjunction with delivery of a new television to the owner; and

(2) Each television manufacturer may develop its own recycling program or may collaborate with other television manufacturers, so long as the program is implemented and fully operational no later than January 1, 2011.

(c) The department shall review each television manufacturer's plan and, within sixty days of receipt of the plan, determine whether the plan complies with this part. If the plan is approved, the department shall notify the television manufacturer or group of television manufacturers. If the plan is rejected, the department shall notify the television manufacturer or group of television manufacturers and provide the reasons for the plan's rejection. Within thirty days after receipt of the department's rejection, the television manufacturer or group of television manufacturers may revise and resubmit the plan to the department for approval.
