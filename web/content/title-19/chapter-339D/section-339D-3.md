**§339D-3 Sales prohibition.** (a) Beginning January 1, 2010, no electronic device manufacturer or retailer shall sell or offer for sale any new covered electronic device for delivery in this State unless:

(1) The covered electronic device is labeled with a brand, and the label is permanently affixed and readily visible; and

(2) The brand is included in a registration that is filed with the department and that is effective pursuant to section 339D-4(b)(3).

(b) Beginning April 1, 2009, the department shall maintain a list of each registered electronic device manufacturer and the brands reported in each electronic device manufacturer's registration and a list of brands for which no electronic device manufacturer has registered. The lists shall be posted on the department website and shall be updated by the first day of each month. Each retailer who sells or offers for sale any new covered electronic device for delivery in this State shall review these lists prior to selling the covered electronic device. A retailer is considered to have complied with subsection (a) if, on the date a new covered electronic device was ordered by the retailer, the brand was included on the department's list of brands reported in an electronic device manufacturer's registration.
