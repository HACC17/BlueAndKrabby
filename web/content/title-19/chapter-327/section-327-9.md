(1) An agent of the decedent at the time of death who could have made an anatomical gift under section 327-4(2) immediately before the decedent's death;

(2) The spouse or reciprocal beneficiary of the decedent;

(3) Adult children of the decedent;

(4) Parents of the decedent;

(5) Adult siblings of the decedent;

(6) Adult grandchildren of the decedent;

(7) Grandparents of the decedent;

(8) An adult who exhibited special care and concern for the decedent;

(9) The persons who were acting as the guardian of the person of the decedent at the time of death; and

(10) Any other person having the authority to dispose of the decedent's body.

(b) If there is more than one member of a class listed in subsection (a)(l), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), or (9) entitled to make an anatomical gift, an anatomical gift may be made by a member of the class unless that member or a person to which the gift can pass under section 327-11 knows of an objection by another member of the class. If an objection is known, the gift may be made only by a majority of the members of the class who are reasonably available.
