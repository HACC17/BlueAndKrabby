**[ยง327-22] Cooperation between medical examiner or coroner and procurement organization.** (a) A medical examiner or coroner shall cooperate with procurement organizations to maximize the opportunity to recover anatomical gifts for transplantation, therapy, research, or education.

(b) If a medical examiner or coroner receives notice from a procurement organization that an anatomical gift might be available or was made with respect to a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner or coroner and a post-mortem examination is going to be performed, unless the medical examiner or coroner denies recovery in accordance with section 327-23, the medical examiner or coroner or designee shall make a reasonable attempt to conduct a post-mortem examination of the body or the body part in a manner and within a period compatible with its preservation for the purposes of the gift.

(c) A body part may not be removed from the body of a decedent under the jurisdiction of a medical examiner or coroner for transplantation, therapy, research, or education unless the body part is the subject of an anatomical gift. The body of a decedent under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner or coroner may not be delivered to a person for research or education unless the body is the subject of an anatomical gift. This subsection shall not preclude a medical examiner or coroner from performing the medicolegal investigation upon the body or body parts of a decedent under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner or coroner.
