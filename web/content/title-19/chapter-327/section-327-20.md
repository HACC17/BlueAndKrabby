**[ยง327-20] Donor registry.** (a) The examiner of drivers shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to allow an organ procurement organization twenty-four-hour telephone access to the driver's license database information, solely for determining whether a driver has indicated a willingness to be an organ donor pursuant to section 286-109.5.

(b) The examiner of drivers shall cooperate with any donor registry that this State establishes, contracts for, or recognizes for transferring to the donor registry all relevant information regarding a donor's making, amendment to, or revocation of an anatomical gift.

(c) A donor registry shall:

(1) Provide a database that allows a donor or other person authorized under section 327-4 to include on the donor registry a statement or symbol that the donor has made, amended, or revoked an anatomical gift;

(2) Be accessible to a procurement organization to allow it to obtain relevant information on the donor registry to determine, at or near death of the donor or a prospective donor, whether the donor or prospective donor has made, amended, or revoked an anatomical gift; and

(3) Be accessible for purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) seven-days-a-week on a twenty-four-hour basis.

(d) Personally identifiable information on a donor registry about a donor or prospective donor may not be used or disclosed without the express consent of the donor, prospective donor, or the person that made the anatomical gift for any purpose other than to determine, at or near death of the donor or a prospective donor, whether the donor or prospective donor has made, amended, or revoked an anatomical gift.

(e) This section shall not prohibit any person from creating or maintaining a donor registry that is not established by or under contract with the State. However, the registry shall comply with subsections (c) and (d). [L 2008, c 122, pt of ยง1]
