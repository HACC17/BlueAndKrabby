**§325-6 Epidemic control.** Such appropriations as may be necessary for the purpose of controlling, suppressing, or preventing the spread of any communicable or preventable disease in the State or in any county thereof shall be allocated by the legislature out of the proceeds of the state general fund. The department shall include in its budgetary request for each upcoming fiscal period, the amounts necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.

Whenever the department of health certifies that any communicable or preventable disease is present to such an extent that the usual facilities and personnel of the department are not adequate to properly control, suppress, or prevent the spread of the disease, expenditures may be made by the department, with the approval of the governor, for use, in whatever manner the department may deem necessary, in controlling, suppressing, or preventing the spread of any such disease.
