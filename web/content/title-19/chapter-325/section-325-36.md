**§325-36 Duty of adult, or of parent, guardian, or caregiver.** (a) Every adult person required to be immunized, or to do any other act, unless the person is a minor or incompetent, shall cause the immunization or other act to be performed.

(b) If the person is a minor or incompetent, the person's parent, or guardian having the person's care, custody, and control, shall cause the immunization or other related act to be performed.

(c) If reasonable efforts have been made to obtain consent from the person's parent or guardian, and consent is not obtainable because the parent or guardian cannot be located or contacted, a caregiver with whom the minor or incompetent person lives, or a non-custodial parent, may cause the immunization or other related act to be performed.
