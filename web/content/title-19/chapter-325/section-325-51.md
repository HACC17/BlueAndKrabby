**PART III. CONGENITAL SYPHILIS**

**§325-51 Blood samples of pregnant women required.** Every physician attending a pregnant woman in the State for conditions relating to the woman's pregnancy during the period of gestation or at delivery, shall, in the case of every woman so attended, take or cause to be taken one or more samples of the blood of the woman, except when the attending physician shall have evidence that a pregnant woman has met this requirement through a previous test for syphilis, and shall submit such samples to an approved laboratory for a standard serologic test for syphilis. Every other person permitted by law to attend pregnant women in the State, but not permitted by law to take blood samples, shall cause one or more samples of the blood of every pregnant woman attended by the person to be taken by a duly licensed physician or state certified laboratory, or any other person permitted by law to withdraw blood and shall have the samples submitted to an approved laboratory for a standard serologic test for syphilis. The samples of blood shall be taken at such times during the period of gestation as are designated by rules adopted by the department of health. Every pregnant woman shall permit the sample of the woman's blood to be taken as hereinabove provided.
