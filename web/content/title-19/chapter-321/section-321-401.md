**[PART XXXII.] FOOD SAFETY CONSULTATIVE AND EDUCATION**

**PROGRAM**

**[§321-401] Findings and purpose.** The purpose of this part is to establish a non-enforcement program within the department of health to provide voluntary food safety surveillance and control, and educational activities to assist the food service industry and foodhandlers. The legislature finds that education is necessary for attaining voluntary compliance in food safety. Informed food managers and foodhandlers are essential for the control of foodborne pathogens in foods served to the public.

Restaurants, catering services, delicatessens, markets, and other food purveyors employ foodhandlers who need continuing education and training in food safety. Foodhandlers work with fresh, uncooked, or prepared foods which may contain foodborne disease microorganisms that can cause severe sickness to large numbers of people at the same time. It is the intent of the legislature to take preventive measures through educational programs and analytical studies of contamination outbreaks. [L 1992, c 219, pt of §1]
