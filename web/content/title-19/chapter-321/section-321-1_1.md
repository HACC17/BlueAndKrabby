**[ยง321-1.1 Development of environmental goals and objectives.]** The department of health, with input from the regulated community and general public, shall develop environmental goals and objectives, to be used in the implementation of its programs which shall ensure that the following natural resources are protected: air quality; land; coastal waters; inland waters; and groundwater. It shall also be the goal of the department to organize its environmental protection programs to improve the coordination of environmental planning and oversight; improve the enforcement of environmental laws, rules, and policies; and improve the ability to identify, prevent, and respond to significant releases of pollutants into the environment. The department of health shall ensure that the environmental goals and objectives will remain current by reviewing them every two years, with input from the regulated community and the general public. The department shall report its findings and conclusions following each such review, to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the legislative session immediately following the completion of the review.
