**[§342H-53]** **Applicability and requirements.** (a) The provisions of this part do not apply to municipal solid waste landfill units that do not receive wastes after October 9, 1991.

(b) Municipal solid waste landfill units that receive waste after October 9, 1991, but stop receiving waste before October 9, 1993, are exempt from the requirements of this part except the final cover requirement prescribed by rules adopted pursuant to this part. The final cover shall be installed within six months of the last receipt of wastes. Owners and operators of municipal solid waste landfill units subject to this subsection that fail to complete cover installation within six months from the date of the last receipt of wastes shall be subject to all the requirements of this part, and rules adopted pursuant to this part, subject to such exemptions as may be provided by those rules.

(c) The provisions of this part apply to owners and operators of new municipal solid waste landfill units, existing municipal solid waste landfill units, and lateral expansions, except as otherwise provided in this part or otherwise exempted by rules adopted pursuant to this part.

(d) Following closure of a municipal solid waste landfill unit, or a component of a municipal solid waste landfill unit, the owner or operator of the unit shall conduct post-closure care for a period of thirty years. The director may increase the length of the post-closure care period if the director determines that the lengthened period is necessary to protect human health and the environment. The director may decrease the length of the post-closure care period if the owner or operator of the closed municipal solid waste landfill unit demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that the reduced period is sufficient to protect human health and the environment.

(e) Owners and operators of municipal solid waste landfill units that receive waste on or after October 9, 1993, shall comply with the financial assurance criteria that the director shall establish by rules adopted pursuant to this part. Such rules shall be effective no later than April 9, 1994.

(f) Municipal solid waste landfill units containing sewage sludge shall comply with the provisions of this part and the rules adopted pursuant to this part.

(g) In addition to compliance with the provisions of this part and rules adopted pursuant to this part, owners and operators of a municipal solid waste landfill unit shall comply with any other applicable state and federal law. [L 1992, c 245, pt of §1]
