**§329-125 Protections afforded to a qualifying patient or primary caregiver.** (a) A qualifying patient or the primary caregiver may assert the medical use of marijuana authorized under this part as an affirmative defense to any prosecution involving marijuana under this part or part IV; or part IV of chapter 712; provided that the qualifying patient or the primary caregiver strictly complied with the requirements of this part.

(b) Any qualifying patient or primary caregiver not complying with the permitted scope of the medical use of marijuana shall not be afforded the protections against searches and seizures pertaining to the misapplication of the medical use of marijuana.

(c) No person shall be subject to arrest or prosecution for simply being in the presence or vicinity of the medical use of marijuana as permitted under this part. [L 2000, c 228, pt of §2; am L 2016, c 230, §10]

Case Notes

Rule of lenity required the construction, under the specific facts of the case, of §§329-121 and 329-122 and this section against the government, as there was an irreconcilable inconsistency between the authorized transportation of medical marijuana under §329-121, and the prohibition on transport of medical marijuana through "any ... place open to the public" under [§329-122(c)(2)(E)]; thus, under §701-115(2)(b), petitioner was entitled to an acquittal because petitioner's evidence, when considered in light of any contrary prosecution evidence proved by a preponderance of the evidence the specified fact or facts with negatived penal liability. 129 H. 397, 301 P.3d 607 (2013).
