Case Notes

This chapter preempted a Hawaii county ordinance that made the enforcement of marijuana laws the lowest enforcement priority in the county, because the ordinance covered the adult personal use of cannabis, which was the same subject matter that the legislature intended to govern under this chapter. 132 H. 511 (App.), 323 P.3d 155 (2014).
