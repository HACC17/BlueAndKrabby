**§338-10 Late determination of the cause of death.** If the cause of death cannot be determined within three days, the certification of its cause may be filed after the prescribed period, but the attending physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or coroner's physician shall notify in writing the local agent of the department of health of the district in which the death occurred of the reason for late filing, in order that a permit for the disposition of the body may be issued.

As used in this section, "late" means more than three days after the date of death. [L 1949, c 327, §14; RL 1955, §57-13; am L Sp 1959 2d, c 1, §19; [HRS §338-10](/title-19/chapter-338/section-338-10/); am L 1973, c 17, §7; am L 1997, c 305, §1; am L 2016, c 183, §5]
