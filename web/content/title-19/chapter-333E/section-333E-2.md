**§333E-2 Developmental disabilities, definitions.** For the purposes of this chapter, the term "developmental disability" means a severe, chronic disability of a person which:

(1) Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical impairments;

(2) Is manifested before the person attains age twenty-two;

(3) Is likely to continue indefinitely;

(4) Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life activity; self-care, receptive and expressive language, learning, mobility, self-direction, capacity for independent living, economic sufficiency; and

(5) Reflects the individual's need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized support, or other forms of assistance that are lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated. An individual from birth to age nine, who has a substantial developmental delay or specific congenital or acquired condition, may be considered to have a developmental disability without meeting three or more of the criteria described above, if the individual, without services and support, has a high probability of meeting those criteria later in life.
