**ยง323F-6 Records.** (a) The corporation and each regional system board shall be subject to the requirements of chapter 92F, except that the following categories of government records shall not be required to be disclosed:

(1) Applications for credentials or staff privileges at any of the corporation's medical facilities, records from peer review proceedings, and medical records; and

(2) Marketing strategies, strategic plans, evaluations, assessments, negotiations, or rates and charges, the disclosure of which would raise the cost of procurement or give a manifestly unfair advantage to any competitor or to any person or entity seeking to do business or proposing to enter into an agreement with a regional system board, the corporation, or any of its facilities.

Any person denied access to any such government records shall have available the remedies specified in sections 92F-15 and 92F-15.5\. Government records protected from disclosure by this section shall be subject to the interagency disclosure provisions of section 92F-19\. Section 624-25.5 shall apply to this part notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section.

(b) The corporation shall have the authority to set rates for copies of records protected by this section from the disclosure requirements of chapter 92F. For medical records subpoenaed from any of the corporation's regional system facilities, copies shall be paid for by the requester in an amount based on the facility's actual cost of preparation; provided that the amount shall be no less than $1 per page and no more than $2 per page.
