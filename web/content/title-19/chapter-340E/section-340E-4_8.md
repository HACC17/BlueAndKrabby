**[ยง340E-4.8] Water catchment systems.** (a) The department shall establish a program to conduct annual testing of water from water catchment systems for lead and copper. Any resident residing in a legal dwelling which relies on a water catchment system for the resident's water needs shall be eligible to participate in the program, subject to the department's procedures and guidelines and the availability of program funds. Residents shall utilize a certified private analytical laboratory specified by the department or the department may conduct the tests. Participating residents shall pay $25 for the tests and the department shall cover the remainder of the testing cost. One set of tests a year for each legal dwelling may be requested under this program.

(b) The department shall establish procedures and guidelines for the testing which shall:

(1) Identify sampling and analytical protocols;

(2) Specify report and notice requirements; and

(3) Determine participation eligibility procedures and requirements.

(c) The department shall establish a nonregulatory program that provides technical assistance to any resident residing in a legal dwelling which relies on a water catchment system for the resident's water needs for the purpose of improving water quality in that system. To the extent practicable, the department shall assist the resident by recommending practical and affordable methods to improve water quality, based on the specific design and conditions of the water catchment system.
