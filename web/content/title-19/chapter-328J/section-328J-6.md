**[ยง328J-6]** **Presumptively reasonable distance**. Smoking is prohibited within a presumptively reasonable minimum distance of twenty feet from entrances, exits, windows that open, and ventilation intakes that serve an enclosed or partially enclosed area where smoking is prohibited. Owners, operators, managers, employers, or other persons who own or control a place open to the public or place of employment may seek to rebut the presumption that twenty feet is a reasonable distance by submitting an application to the department. The presumption will be rebutted if the applicant can show by clear and convincing evidence that, given the circumstances presented by the location of entrances, exits, windows that open, ventilation intakes, or other factors, smoke will not infiltrate into the place open to the public or place of employment.
