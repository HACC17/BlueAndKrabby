**[ยง321C-1] General purpose; purpose of the office of language access.** Many individuals living in Hawaii read, write, speak, and understand English. There are many individuals, however, who are limited English proficient. Language for limited English proficient persons can be a barrier to accessing important benefits or services, understanding and exercising important rights, complying with applicable responsibilities, or understanding other information provided by state-funded programs and activities.

The purpose of this chapter is to affirmatively address, on account of national origin, the language access needs of limited English proficient persons. It is the intent of the legislature that these services be guided by Executive Order No. 13166 and succeeding provisions of federal law, regulation, or guidance.

The purpose of the office of language access is to address the language access needs of limited English proficient persons and ensure meaningful access to services, programs, and activities offered by the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government, including departments, offices, commissions, boards, or other agencies, and all covered entities, for limited English proficient persons.
