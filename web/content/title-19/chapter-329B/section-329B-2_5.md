**[ยง329B-2.5]** **Exemptions.** This chapter does not apply to:

(1) Toxicology tests used in the direct clinical management of patients;

(2) Tests for alcohol under chapter 286 or chapter 291;

(3) Tests made pursuant to subpart C of the Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (53 Federal Register 11986); and

(4) Substance abuse testing of individuals under the supervision or custody of the judiciary, the department of public safety, the Hawaii paroling authority, and the office of youth services. However, these state governmental entities shall establish chain of custody procedures which require that all specimens be sealed and coded in the presence of the individual being tested and that the individual shall sign an approved form acknowledging that the specimen has been sealed and coded in the individual's presence. The procedure shall include a tracking form documenting the handling and storage of the specimen from collection to final disposition of the specimen. The individual also shall be afforded the option of a confirmatory test by a licensed, certified laboratory. The cost of the confirmatory test shall be paid for by the State; provided that in those instances where a positive test result is confirmed, the individual shall be charged with the cost of the confirmation test. Test results shall not require review by a medical review officer. Positive test results of substance abuse testing and the availability of a confirmatory test shall be provided to the individual in writing. A positive test result from a substance abuse test that fails to meet the requirements of this section shall not be reported or recorded. [L 1993, c 158, ยง1]
