**[ยง412:12-107] Powers; additional branches.** (a) An out-of-state state bank which establishes and operates a branch in Hawaii under this article may conduct any activities at the branch that are authorized under the laws of this State for Hawaii state banks chartered under article 5 of this chapter.

(b) A Hawaii state bank may conduct any activities at any branch outside Hawaii that are permissible for a bank chartered by the host state where the branch is located, except to the extent the activities are expressly prohibited by the laws of this State or by any rule or order of the commissioner applicable to the Hawaii state bank; provided that the commissioner may waive any prohibition if the commissioner determines, by order or rule, that the involvement of out-of-state branches of Hawaii state banks in particular activities would not threaten the safety or soundness of those banks.

(c) An out-of-state bank that has established or acquired a branch in Hawaii under this article may establish or acquire additional branches or other places of business as authorized pursuant to section 412:3-501 in Hawaii to the same extent that any Hawaii bank may establish or acquire a branch or other places of business in Hawaii under applicable federal and state law.

(d) If an out-of-state bank operates two or more branches in Hawaii, the out-of-state bank shall designate one of its branches as its principal office in this State. [L 1996, c 155, pt of ยง1]
