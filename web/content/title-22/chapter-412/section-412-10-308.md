**ยง412:10-308 Payable-on-death accounts.** Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a credit union may establish share and deposit accounts payable to one or more persons during their lifetimes and on the death of all of them to one or more payable-on-death payees. Any transfer to a payable-on-death payee is effective by reason of the account contract and shall not be considered to be a testamentary transfer. [L 1993, c 350, pt of ยง1]
