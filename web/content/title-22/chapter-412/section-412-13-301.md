**[ยง412:13-301] Establishment of interstate branches in this State by out-of-state foreign banks.** (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), an out-of-state foreign bank may establish an interstate Hawaii state branch in the same manner (including by merger or other transactions under section 44 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and comparable provisions of the laws of this State, with Hawaii banks or other institutions) as, and generally subject to the same criteria, standards, conditions, requirements, and procedures applicable to the establishment of interstate branches in this State by, an out-of-state bank having the same home state in the United States, notwithstanding any provision of the laws or rules of this State to the contrary.

(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), the commissioner:

(1) Shall apply to the establishment of an initial interstate Hawaii state branch, and subsequent intrastate Hawaii state branches, of any out-of-state foreign bank the same criteria, standards, conditions, requirements, and procedures applicable under part II of this article, or rules thereunder to the establishment of an initial Hawaii state branch, and of subsequent intrastate Hawaii state branches, respectively;

(2) May apply any other criteria, standards, conditions, requirements, or provisions of the laws or rules of this State that are determined by the commissioner to be substantially equivalent to or consistent with criteria, standards, conditions, requirements, or provisions of federal law or regulation generally applicable to the establishment of branches in the United States by foreign banks or specifically applicable to the establishment of a branch in the United States by the applicant foreign bank;

(3) May by rule or order allow an out-of-state foreign bank:

(A) To acquire an individual branch of any "insured bank" within the meaning of section 3(h) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(h)), or of any other depository institution, including another foreign bank, without acquiring the entire bank or other institution; or

(B) To acquire or merge with another foreign bank maintaining a Hawaii state branch or agency and thereafter continue operations as its own; and

(C) To acquire or establish an interstate Hawaii state branch through any other means not inconsistent with section 5 of the federal International Banking Act (12 U.S.C. 3103). [L 1996, c 155, pt of ยง2]
