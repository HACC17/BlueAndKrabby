If the opening or relocation will not be completed within nine months after the opening date stated in the application, the financial institution may obtain from the commissioner an extension of the time to open or relocate, which shall be reasonably granted for good cause. If an extension of time to open or relocate is not obtained in writing, the commissioner may revoke the permission to open or relocate. [L 1993, c 350, pt of ยง1]
