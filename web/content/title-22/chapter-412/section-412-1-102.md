(3) To the extent permitted by federal law, all federal financial institutions transacting business in this State.

(b) A person shall not be deemed to be doing business in this State simply because it participates in a mortgage loan transaction with a Hawaii financial institution or a federal financial institution whose operations are principally conducted in this State by purchasing, acquiring, transferring, servicing, enforcing, or otherwise dealing with mortgaged property located in this State, or by foreclosing upon, or acquiring title to mortgaged property in case of a default under the mortgage, securing the rents and profits therefrom, or disposing of the same.
