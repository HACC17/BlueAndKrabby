**[§412:13-205] Amended license to establish and maintain a branch or agency.** (a) A foreign bank that is licensed to establish and maintain a Hawaii state branch or Hawaii state agency shall secure an amended license if it changes its corporate name, changes the duration of its corporate existence, or desires to pursue in this State other or additional purposes than those set forth in its prior application for a license under this article, by making application therefor to the commissioner.

(b) The requirements with respect to the form and contents of an application under subsection (a), the manner of its execution, the filing of triplicate originals thereof with the commissioner, the payment of an application fee, the issuance of an amended license, and the effect thereof shall be the same as in the case of an initial application for a license to establish and maintain a Hawaii state branch or Hawaii state agency. [L 1996, c 155, pt of §2]
