**ยง412:10-410 Lines of credit.** A credit union may offer its members self-replenishing lines of credit. Loan advances within the limits of a line of credit may be made without the necessity of submitting additional loan applications; provided that the applicant qualifies for the line of credit and the applicant's aggregate indebtedness under the line of credit does not exceed the approved limit. The board, credit committee or credit manager shall review, or cause to be reviewed, all lines of credit at least once every three years. [L 1993, c 350, pt of ยง1]
