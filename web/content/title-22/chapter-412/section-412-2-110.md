**[ยง412:2-110] Emergency applications.** Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an application may be approved by the commissioner without investigation, notice, comment, or hearing in any case in which the commissioner determines to be an emergency arising from the insolvency of an existing institution or to prevent the failure of an existing institution. No emergency application may be granted unless the commissioner determines that the relevant statutory criteria have been met. Notwithstanding the granting of any approval, if the commissioner discovers good cause why an approval should not have been granted, the approval may be revoked by giving written notice of revocation to the applicant. [L 2001, c 170, pt of ยง1]
