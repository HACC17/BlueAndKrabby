**§412:2-306 Removal or prohibition of institution-affiliated party; grounds.** (a) The commissioner may order the removal of any institution-affiliated party from office or employment with a Hawaii financial institution and the prohibition of the party's affiliation or participation in the affairs of the financial institution or any other Hawaii financial institution if the commissioner determines that all three of the following circumstances exist:

(1) The institution-affiliated party has violated this chapter or any rules adopted pursuant to this chapter, violated a cease and desist order that has become effective, engaged or participated in an unsafe or unsound practice in connection with the financial institution, or breached a fiduciary duty owed to the financial institution;

(2) By reason of such violation, practice, or breach the financial institution has suffered or will probably suffer financial loss or other damage, the interests of the financial institution's depositors have been or may be prejudiced, or the institution-affiliated party has received financial gain or other benefit as a result of the violation, practice, or breach; and

(3) The violation, practice, or breach involves the institution-affiliated party's personal dishonesty or demonstrates the party's wilful or continuing disregard for the safety or soundness of the financial institution.

(b) The commissioner may also order the removal of any institution-affiliated party from office or employment with a Hawaii financial institution and the prohibition of the party's affiliation or participation in the affairs of the financial institution or any other Hawaii financial institution if the commissioner determines that:

(1) The institution-affiliated party has been charged in any information, indictment, or complaint authorized by a United States attorney, state attorney general, or similar legal officer, with the commission of, or participation in, a crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust that is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under state or federal law; and

(2) The continued service by the institution-affiliated party may pose a threat to the interests of the financial institution's depositors or may threaten to impair public confidence in the institution. [L 1993, c 350, pt of §1; am L 2001, c 170, §3; am L 2006, c 228, §7; am L 2008, c 196, §2]
