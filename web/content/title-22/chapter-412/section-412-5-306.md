**ยง412:5-306** **Deposits made by banks.** A bank may deposit any of its funds with (1) a federal reserve bank or a federal home loan bank in any amount, or (2) another depository institution, provided that the net deposits in any one depository institution does not exceed twenty-five per cent of the bank's capital and surplus, unless otherwise permitted by federal law. In this section, "net deposits in any one depository institution" means the sum of (1) balances, other than demand balances, due from the institution and (2) demand balances due from the institution, less any demand balances due to that institution if that office of the institution in which the deposit is made is located in the United States.
