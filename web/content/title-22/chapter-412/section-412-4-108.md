**ยง412:4-108 No notice of incapacity.** If a financial institution has not received written notice and is not on actual notice that a deposit account holder has been adjudicated an incapacitated person by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law, it may make payments or allow transfers or withdrawals from the account to or on the order of the account holder in accordance with the provisions of its contract with the holder, and such payment, transfer or withdrawal shall operate to release and discharge the financial institution from further liability to the account holder and the holder's successors in interest with respect to the funds so paid, transferred or withdrawn, and no action at law or equity may be maintained against the financial institution for payment, transfer or withdrawal in accordance with this section.
