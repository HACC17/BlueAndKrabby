**[ยง412:13-209] Filing of amendments to articles of incorporation.** A foreign bank that is licensed to maintain a Hawaii state branch or Hawaii state agency, whenever its articles of incorporation are amended, shall forthwith file in the office of the commissioner a copy of the amendment duly authenticated by the proper officer of the country of the foreign bank's organization, but the filing thereof may not of itself enlarge or alter the purpose or purposes for which the foreign bank is authorized to pursue in the transaction of its business in this State, nor authorize the foreign bank to transact business in this State under any name other than the name set forth in its license, nor extend the duration of its corporate existence. If the amendment is in a foreign language, an English translation of the amendment under the oath of the translator shall accompany the amendment. [L 1996, c 155, pt of ยง2]
