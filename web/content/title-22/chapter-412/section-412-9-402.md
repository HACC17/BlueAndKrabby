The depository financial services loan company may have and exercise all powers not in conflict with the laws of this State incident to such membership; provided, however, that notwithstanding such membership the depository financial services loan company and its directors, officers, and shareholders shall continue to be subject to all liabilities and duties imposed upon them by any law of this State.
