**§412:2-108 Alternative mortgage loans rules.** The commissioner may by rule permit financial institutions to make loans secured by mortgages that do not meet the loan-to-value ratio, payment terms, compounding of interest, or other requirements contained under this chapter, chapter 478 or other law of this State, including but not limited to, alternative mortgage loans, such as "reverse annuity" and "graduated payment" mortgage loans. Such rules may specify the borrowers eligible for such alternative mortgage loans, and the limitations, restrictions, and other requirements the commissioner shall deem appropriate. [L 1993, c 350, pt of §1]
