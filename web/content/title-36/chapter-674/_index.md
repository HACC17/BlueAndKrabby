Case Notes

Trial court erred in granting plaintiffs the right to sue for breach of contract under chapter 661 where, with respect to the individual beneficiary claims under this chapter, the language of Act 14, L Sp 1995 merely indicated the legislature's expressed desire for "title-related" claims to be settled in a timely manner. 111 H. 84, 137 P.3d 990 (2006).
