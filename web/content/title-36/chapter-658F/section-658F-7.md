**[ยง658F-7] Effect of recognition of foreign-country judgment.** If the court in a proceeding under section 658F-6 finds that the foreign-country judgment is entitled to recognition under this chapter then, to the extent that the foreign-country judgment grants or denies recovery of a sum of money, the foreign-country judgment is:

(1) Conclusive between the parties to the same extent as the judgment of a sister state entitled to full faith and credit in this State would be conclusive; and

(2) Enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as a judgment rendered in this State. [L 2009, c 34, pt of ยง1]
