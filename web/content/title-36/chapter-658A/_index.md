Case Notes

Where appellant was already bound by an arbitration agreement executed on February 24, 2000, and therefore the post-July 1, 2002 arbitration agreement was not a "new" arbitration agreement that would dictate the application of this chapter to the arbitration proceedings, ยง658A-3(a) was inapplicable to the case. 113 H. 127, 149 P.3d 495 (2006).

To the extent that there may be a conflict between the jurisdictional provisions of this chapter and chapter 89, chapter 89 takes precedence over this chapter. 132 H. 492 (App.), 323 P.3d 136 (2014).
