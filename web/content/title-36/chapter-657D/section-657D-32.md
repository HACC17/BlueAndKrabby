**[ยง657D-32]** **Persons entitled to benefits; applications; amount of insurance protected.** The benefits and privileges of this part shall apply to any insured when the insured, or a person designated by the insured, makes written application for protection under this part, unless the insurance commissioner in passing on the application finds that the policy is not entitled to protection under this part. The adjutant general shall give notice to the state military forces of the provisions of this part, and shall include in the notice an explanation of the provisions for the information of those desiring to make application for benefits. The original of the application shall be sent by the insured to the insurer, and a copy to the insurance commissioner. The total amount of insurance on the life of one insured under policies covered by this part shall not exceed $10,000\. If an insured applies for protection of policies on the insured's life totaling insurance in excess of $10,000, the insurance commissioner may have the amount of insurance divided into two or more policies so that the protection of this part may be extended to include policies for a total amount of insurance not to exceed $10,000, and a policy which affords the best security to the government shall be given preference.
