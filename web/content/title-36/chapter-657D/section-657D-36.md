**[ยง657D-36] Deduction of unpaid premiums upon settlement of policies maturing during protection.** In the event of maturity of a policy as a death claim or otherwise before the expiration of the period of protection under this part, the insurer in making settlement shall deduct from the amount of insurance the premiums guaranteed under this part, together with interest thereon at the rate fixed in the policy for policy loans. If no rate of interest is specifically fixed in the policy, the rate shall be the rate fixed for policy loans in other policies issued by the insurer at the time the policy brought under this chapter was issued. The amount deducted by reason of the protection afforded by this part shall be reported by the insurer to the insurance commissioner. [L 1994, c 257, pt of ยง2]
