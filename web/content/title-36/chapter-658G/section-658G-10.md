**[ยง**<a>**658G-**</a><a></a><a></a><a>**10] L****ow income parties.**</a> (a) The disqualification of section 658G-9(a) applies to a collaborative lawyer representing a party with or without fee.

(b) After a collaborative law process concludes, another lawyer in a law firm with which a collaborative lawyer disqualified under section 658G-9(a) is associated may represent a party without fee in the collaborative matter or a matter related to the collaborative matter if:

(1) The party has an annual income that qualifies the party for free legal representation under the criteria established by the law firm for free legal representation;

(2) The collaborative law participation agreement so provides; and

(3) The collaborative lawyer is isolated from any participation in the collaborative matter or a matter related to the collaborative matter through procedures within the law firm which are reasonably calculated to isolate the collaborative lawyer from that participation. [L 2012, c 207, pt of ยง1]
