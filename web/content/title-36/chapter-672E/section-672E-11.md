**[§672E-11] Contract of sale; provisions.** (a) Upon entering into a contract for sale of a new structure or the construction or substantial remodeling of a premises, the seller of the new structure shall provide to the purchaser of the new structure, and the contractor of the construction or substantial remodeling of the premises shall provide to the owner of the premises, notice of the contractors right to resolve alleged construction defects before a claimant may commence litigation against the contractor. The notice shall be conspicuous and included as part of the contract.

(b) The notice required by subsection (a) shall explicitly reference this chapter, and shall be in substantially the following form:

"CHAPTER 672E OF THE HAWAII REVISED STATUTES CONTAINS IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS YOU MUST FOLLOW BEFORE YOU MAY FILE A LAWSUIT OR OTHER ACTION FOR DEFECTIVE CONSTRUCTION AGAINST THE CONTRACTOR WHO DESIGNED, REPAIRED, OR CONSTRUCTED YOUR HOME OR FACILITY. NINETY DAYS BEFORE YOU FILE YOUR LAWSUIT OR OTHER ACTION, YOU MUST SERVE ON THE CONTRACTOR A WRITTEN NOTICE OF ANY CONSTRUCTION CONDITIONS YOU ALLEGE ARE DEFECTIVE. UNDER THE LAW, A CONTRACTOR HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE AN OFFER TO REPAIR AND/OR PAY FOR THE DEFECTS. YOU ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO ACCEPT ANY OFFER MADE BY A CONTRACTOR. THERE ARE STRICT DEADLINES AND PROCEDURES UNDER THE LAW, AND FAILURE TO FOLLOW THEM MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO FILE A LAWSUIT OR OTHER ACTION."
