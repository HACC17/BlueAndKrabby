(2) The transferee shall be liable to the structured settlement obligor and the annuity issuer:

(A) For any taxes incurred by the parties as a consequence of the transfer, if the transfer contravenes the terms of the structured settlement; and

(B) For any other liabilities or costs, including reasonable costs and attorneys' fees, arising from compliance by the parties with the order of the court or responsible administrative authority, or arising as a consequence of the transferee's failure to comply with this chapter;

(3) Neither the annuity issuer nor the structured settlement obligor may be required to divide any periodic payment between the payee and any transferee or assignee or between two or more transferees or assignees; and
