**[ยง****667-93] Recordation of notice of default and intention to foreclose.** Before the deadline date in the notice of default and intention to foreclose, the notice may be recorded in a recordable form in a manner similar to recordation of notices of pendency of action under section 501-151 or section 634-51, or both, as applicable. The recorded notice of default and intention to foreclose shall have the same effect as a notice of pendency of action. From and after the recordation of the notice of default and intention to foreclose, any person who becomes a purchaser or encumbrancer of the unit shall be deemed to have constructive notice of the power of sale foreclosure and shall be bound by the foreclosure.
