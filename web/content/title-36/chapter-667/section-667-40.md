**[ยง667-40] Use of power of sale foreclosure in certain non-mortgage situations.** A power of sale foreclosure under this part may be used in certain non-mortgage situations where a law or a written document contains, authorizes, permits, or provides for a power of sale, a power of sale foreclosure, a power of sale remedy, or a nonjudicial foreclosure. These laws or written documents are limited to those involving time share plans, condominium property regimes, and agreements of sale. [L 1998, c 122, pt of ยง1]
