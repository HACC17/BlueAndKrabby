**§667-63 Notice to mortgage creditors**. (a) A mortgage creditor having a mortgage lien on a time share interest who desires notice that another mortgage creditor having a mortgage lien on the time share interest intends to foreclose and sell the mortgaged time share interest, pursuant to the power of sale under section 667-62, may submit a written request to the mortgagee who is foreclosing or who may foreclose the mortgage by power of sale, asking to receive notice of the mortgagee's intention to foreclose the mortgage under section 667-62\. The request for notice:

(1) May be submitted any time after the recordation of the subject mortgage; provided that the request is submitted prior to completion of publication of notice of the intention to foreclose the mortgage and of the sale of the mortgaged time share interest;

(2) Shall be signed by the mortgage creditor desiring to receive notice, or its authorized representative; and

(3) Shall specify the name and address of the person to whom the notice is to be mailed.

(b) The mortgagee receiving the request shall thereafter give notice to all mortgage creditors who have timely submitted their request. The notice shall be sent by mail or otherwise communicated to the mortgage creditors not less than seven calendar days prior to the day of sale.

(c) No request for a copy of any notice pursuant to this section nor any statement or allegation in any such request nor any record thereof shall affect the title to the time share interest or be deemed notice to any person that any party requesting copy of the notice has or claims any right, title, or interest in, or lien or charge upon the time share interest described in the mortgage referred to therein.
