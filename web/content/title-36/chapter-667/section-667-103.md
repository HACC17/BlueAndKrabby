**[ยง667-103] Recordation; full satisfaction of debt by unit owner.** Except as provided in section 667-92(f)(2), the recordation of both the conveyance document and the affidavit shall not operate as full satisfaction of the debt owed by the unit owner to the association unless the sale proceeds from the unit or the amounts paid by a purchaser under the special assessment permitted by section 421J-10.5 or 514B-146 are sufficient to satisfy the unit owner's debt to the association, including the association's legal fees and costs. The debts of other lien creditors are unaffected except as provided in this part. [L 2012, c 182, pt of ยง3(2)]
