**[ยง671D-12] Attorney's fees.** (a) In any suit brought against a defendant, to the extent that a defendant has met the standards set forth under section 671D-11(a) and the defendant substantially prevails, the court, at the conclusion of the action, shall award to a substantially prevailing party defending against any such claim the cost of the suit attributable to such claim, including a reasonable attorney's fee, if the claim, or the claimant's conduct during the litigation of the claim, was frivolous, unreasonable, without foundation, or in bad faith.

(b) For the purposes of this section, a defendant shall not be considered to have substantially prevailed when the plaintiff obtains an award for damages, or permanent injunctive or declaratory relief. [L 1989, c 354, pt of ยง3 and c 363, pt of ยง3]
