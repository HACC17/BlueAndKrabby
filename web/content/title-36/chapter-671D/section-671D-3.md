**[ยง671D-3] Findings.** The legislature finds the following:

(1) There is an overriding need to provide incentive and protection for physicians engaging in effective professional peer review;

(2) The occurrence of medical malpractice actions has become a problem in Hawaii which can be addressed in part by promoting more effective peer review; and

(3) The threat of private money damage liability under state laws unreasonably discourages physicians from participating in effective professional peer review. [L 1989, c 354, pt of ยง3 and c 363, pt of ยง3]
