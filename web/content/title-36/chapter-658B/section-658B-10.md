**[ยง658B-10] Enforcement of foreign judgments.** (a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c), if an action is brought to enforce a judgment of another jurisdiction expressed in a foreign money and the judgment is recognized in this State as enforceable, the enforcing judgment must be entered as provided in section 658B-7 whether or not the foreign judgment confers an option to pay in an equivalent amount of United States dollars. A satisfaction or partial payment made upon the foreign judgment, on proof thereof, must be credited against the amount of foreign money specified in the judgment, notwithstanding the entry of judgment in this State.

(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a foreign judgment may be filed in accordance with any statute of this State providing a procedure for its recognition and enforcement.

(c) A judgment entered on a foreign-money claim only in United States dollars in another state must be enforced in this State in United States dollars only. [L 1990, c 50, pt of ยง1]
