**§668-10 Allotments for shares under unproved ownership.** In any case where the legal title of a claimant to any particular share or interest has not been shown to the satisfaction of the court but the claimant has color of title thereto and the claim is not controverted, the court may in the general partition allot and set apart, for the benefit and account of the legal owner or owners of the share when ascertained, such a portion or portions of the property as the legal owner or owners of the share would be entitled to receive, to be finally disposed of as hereinafter provided; or similarly, the court may set aside a corresponding portion of the proceeds of any sale thereof, for like disposition thereafter. In either case the court may then proceed with partition of the remainder as herein otherwise provided.
