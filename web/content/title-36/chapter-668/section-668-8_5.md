**ยง668-8.5 Adverse claimants.** Unless the action is combined with an action under chapter 669, a person who has not appeared and who claims to hold by title paramount to that under which the plaintiff claims as a cotenant shall not be concluded by the judgment, but may maintain an action asserting that person's title against any or all of the parties, or persons holding under them, within the time in which that person might have brought the action if the action for partition had not been filed. [L 1972, c 90, ยง11(1); am L 2016, c 55, ยง48]
