Case Notes

Where breach of trust claims were for damages resulting from the State's breach of trust duties and did not require a determination of the office of Hawaiian affairs' proportionate share of revenues under §673-9, this chapter applied to the instant claims. 110 H. 338, 133 P.3d 767 (2006).

Where plaintiffs failed to comply with the sixty-day notice requirement for filing suit under §673-3, this failure precluded the supreme court from reviewing any claims brought under this chapter. 110 H. 338, 133 P.3d 767 (2006).

Defendant State and state officials did not waive their sovereign immunity pursuant to chapter 673 where plaintiffs did not bring their claims under chapter 673 in their first amended complaint and plaintiffs' after-the-fact reliance on chapter 673 for a waiver of the State's sovereign immunity was solely for the purpose of their attorneys' fee request. 130 H. 162, 307 P.3d 142 (2013).
