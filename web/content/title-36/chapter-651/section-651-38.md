**§651-38 Alias writs.** Any circuit court, out of which an execution has been issued, if such execution has been returned unsatisfied wholly or in part, may issue an alias execution to the same circuit, or an execution leviable in some other circuit, for the satisfaction of the unpaid remainder of the judgment and additional costs, expenses, and commissions, which alias or testatum writ of execution shall be served in like manner as the original. [CC 1859, §1030; RL 1925, §2442; RL 1935, §4141; RL 1945, §10168; RL 1955, §233-37; [HRS §651-38](/title-36/chapter-651/section-651-38/)]

Case Notes

Alias execution allowed when original execution issued by mistake for too small an amount. 10 H. 348 (1896).

Alias execution issued after dismissal of appeal may be good even if original bad. 15 H. 486 (1904).
