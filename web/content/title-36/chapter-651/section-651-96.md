**ยง651-96 After sale, money equal to real property exemption protected.** The money paid to the defendant as the defendant's exemption shall be entitled, for the period of six months thereafter, to the same protection against attachment and execution which section 651-92 gives to the real property. If the defendant, within such six-month period, applies such proceeds to the purchase of real property, the date of such acquisition and commencement of residence for the purpose of section 651-92(b)(5), shall be considered to be the date of the acquisition of interest in and commencement of residence on the real property whose sale resulted in such proceeds.
