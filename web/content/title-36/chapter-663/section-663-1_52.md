**[§663-1.52] Exception to liability for county lifeguard services.** _[Section repealed June 30, 2017\. L 2014, c 98,_ _§1.]_ (a) For the purpose of this section:

"County lifeguard" means a person employed as a lifeguard by a county of this State.

"Employing county" means the county employing a county lifeguard.

(b) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a county lifeguard, the employing county, and the State shall not be liable for any civil damages resulting from any act or omission of the lifeguard while providing rescue, resuscitative, or other lifeguard services on the beach or in the ocean in the scope of employment as a county lifeguard. This exception from liability, however, shall not apply when the claim for civil damages results from a county lifeguard's gross negligence or wanton act or omission.
