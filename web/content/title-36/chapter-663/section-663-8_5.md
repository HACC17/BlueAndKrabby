Case Notes

Where murder victim would have had cause of action for loss of enjoyment of life and other nonpecuniary losses under this section had murder victim survived, under ยง663-7, victim's claim survived victim's death and victim's estate may sue for such damages. 87 H. 273 (App.), 954 P.2d 652 (1998).
