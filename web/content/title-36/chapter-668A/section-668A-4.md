(b) If an order of service by publication of the summons for an action for partition of real property is granted and the court determines that the property may be heirs property, the plaintiff, not later than ten days after the court's determination, shall post, and maintain while the action is pending, a conspicuous sign on the property that is the subject of the action. The sign shall state that the action has commenced and identify the name and address of the court and the common designation by which the property is known. The court may require the plaintiff to publish on the sign the name of the plaintiff and the known defendants. [L 2016, c 260, pt of ยง1]
