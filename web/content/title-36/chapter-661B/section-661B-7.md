**[ยง661B-7] Exclusive remedy.** (a) Notwithstanding any other law, including the common law, to the contrary, this chapter sets forth the exclusive remedy for any person seeking compensation of any kind or nature whatsoever, as a result of, related to, or arising from a conviction and imprisonment for crimes for which the person was actually innocent. This section shall be strictly construed in favor of any person against whom a claim is asserted, and against the person asserting the claim.

(b) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, should the petitioner die before a final judgment in the circuit court is entered, the petitioner's claim shall abate in its entirety. [L 2016, c 156, pt of ยง2]
