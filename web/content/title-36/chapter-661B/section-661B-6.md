**[ยง661B-6] Waiver of sovereign immunity.** This chapter shall constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity by the State only for the claims brought pursuant to this chapter. The State makes no other waiver of sovereign immunity, and fully retains its sovereign immunity as to all other claims, however denominated, that seek compensation of any kind or nature that are a result of, related to, or arise from a conviction and imprisonment for crimes for which the claimant alleges actual innocence. This section shall be broadly construed in favor of the State and against any waiver of sovereign immunity. [L 2016, c 156, pt of ยง2]
