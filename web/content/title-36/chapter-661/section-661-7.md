(b) Any person who intentionally submits a false claim or attempts to commit a fraud against the State in the proof, statement, establishment, or allowance of any claim under $5,000 or any part of any claim under $5,000 against the State shall, in addition to any other penalty provided by law, be liable for civil penalties of:

(1) Payment of interest on the amount of excess benefits or payments at the maximum legal rate in effect on the date the payment was made to the person, for the period from the date upon which payment was made to the date upon which repayment is made to the State;

(2) Payment of an amount not to exceed double the amount of such excess benefits or payments; and

(3) Payment in the sum of $1,000 for each fraudulent claim or part of a fraudulent claim made against the State.
