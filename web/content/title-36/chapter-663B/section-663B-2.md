Case Notes

If plaintiff's claims that ranch tour guide failed to reasonably supervise the equine activities that were the proximate cause of plaintiff's injury were correct, the presumption of non-negligence set forth in this section would not apply; thus it was error for trial court to apply this section to the case. 111 H. 254, 141 P.3d 427 (2006).
