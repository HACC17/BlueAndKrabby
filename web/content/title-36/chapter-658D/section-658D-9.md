**[§658D-9] Enforcement.** (a) Arbitral or other awards or settlements issued pursuant to this chapter by the center shall be enforced by the circuit courts of this State as permitted by law and consistent with the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §201, et seq., and the enforcement provisions of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, as implemented by 9 U.S.C. §201, et seq., unless subsection (b) below is applicable.

(b) Where the parties specifically submit to jurisdiction of this chapter pursuant to section 658D-6, the center may require those parties residing in countries not signatories to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, as implemented by 9 U.S.C. §201, et seq., and not having sufficient assets otherwise within the jurisdiction of the circuit courts of this State, to post such bonds or other security as the center shall deem appropriate to ensure reasonable likelihood of enforcement of any award or other relief ultimately ordered by the center in the proceeding.
