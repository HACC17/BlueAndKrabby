**§578-3 Custody of child pendente lite.** At any stage of the proceeding subsequent to the filing of the petition and prior to the entry of a decree, the court, upon a showing that the best interests of the child will be served thereby, may order that the petitioner or petitioners shall be entitled to retain the custody and control of the child and shall be responsible for the care, maintenance and support of the child including any necessary medical or surgical treatment, pending the further order of the court. Such order may also authorize and legally obligate the petitioner or petitioners to arrange for the burial of the child if the child shall die prior to the entry of the decree.
