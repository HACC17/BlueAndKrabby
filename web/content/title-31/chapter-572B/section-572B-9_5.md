Case Notes

Complaint challenging the constitutionality of the civil unions law was moot because Act 267, L 2012, amended the civil unions law retroactively to add an immunity provision [this section], which provided immunity for religious organizations that refused to make their facilities available for solemnizing civil unions. Granting leave to amend complaint would be futile because the action would remain nonjusticiable; plaintiffs did not demonstrate that they had standing or that the action was ripe. 903 F. Supp. 2d 1024 (2012).
