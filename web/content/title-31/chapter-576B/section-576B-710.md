**§576B-710 Foreign support agreement.** (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d), a tribunal of this State shall recognize and enforce a foreign support agreement registered in this State.

(b) An application or direct request for recognition and enforcement of a foreign support agreement shall be accompanied by:

(1) A complete text of the foreign support agreement; and

(2) A record stating that the foreign support agreement is enforceable as an order of support in the issuing country.

(c) A tribunal of this State may vacate the registration of a foreign support agreement only if, acting on its own motion, the tribunal finds that recognition and enforcement would be manifestly incompatible with public policy.

(d) In a contest of a foreign support agreement, a tribunal of this State may refuse recognition and enforcement of the agreement if it finds:

(1) Recognition and enforcement of the agreement is manifestly incompatible with public policy;

(2) The agreement was obtained by fraud or falsification;

(3) The agreement is incompatible with a support order involving the same parties and having the same purpose in this State, another state, or a foreign country if the support order is entitled to recognition and enforcement under this chapter in this State; or

(4) The record submitted under subsection (b) lacks authenticity or integrity.

(e) A proceeding for recognition and enforcement of a foreign support agreement shall be suspended during the pendency of a challenge to or appeal of the agreement before a tribunal of another state or a foreign country. [L 2015, c 77, pt of §1]
