**[ยง587A-40] Court records.** The court shall keep a record of all child protective proceedings under this chapter. Written reports, photographs, x-rays, or other information that are submitted to the court may be made available to other appropriate persons, who are not parties, only upon an order of the court. The court may issue this order upon determining that such access is in the best interests of the child or serves some other legitimate purpose.

As set forth in rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91 by the department of human services and consistent with applicable laws, the department may disclose information in the court record without order of the court, unless otherwise ordered by the court. [L 2010, c 135, pt of ยง1]
