**[ยง587A-24] Motions to vacate or modify prior orders brought or decided upon pursuant to rule 59, Hawaii family court rules.** In considering a party's motion to vacate or modify prior orders brought or decided upon pursuant to rule 59, Hawaii family court rules, the court need not commence a trial or hearing de novo, but rather, after such further hearing as the court deems to be appropriate, may proceed to enter such orders as are in the best interests of the child.
