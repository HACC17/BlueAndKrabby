Case Notes

There is no relative preference in this chapter with regard to permanent placement of foster children; to the extent that the department of human services' policy directives mandate such a preference, those policies impermissibly alter this chapter and its legislative history. 132 H. 368, 322 P.3d 263 (2014).

This chapter does not require that relatives must be given preference in placing a child after the birth parents' rights have been terminated; even assuming there was a preference for relative placement, it would not supersede best interest considerations. Although placement with a relative after termination of parental rights may have certain advantages, the paramount and overriding consideration is the best interests of the child. 130 H. 486 (App.), 312 P.3d 1193 (2013).

**Prior law.**

Federal army regulations that mirror chapter 587 did not give rise to a "special relationship"; chapter 587 only creates a "special relationship" between department of human services and abused children who have been reported to it, not between private persons and abused children, and consequently, the United States government cannot be found to have a duty under chapter 587, and thus, no imposition of liability on the United States for negligence under the federal Tort Claims Act. 711 F. Supp. 2d 1195 (2010).
