Case Notes

Where defendant testified at defendant's criminal trial that complainant was defendant's niece and that they had formerly resided together at the home of defendant's father, this testimony established that defendant and complainant met the definition of "family or household member" under this section; thus, family court had jurisdiction to issue the protection order under §586-5.5 and the protection order was valid. 112 H. 136 (App.), 144 P.3d 584 (2006).
