**[ยง586-24] Enforcement of foreign protective orders.** (a) A law enforcement officer shall enforce a foreign protective order that appears to be authentic on its face. For purposes of this section, "authentic on its face" means the protective order contains the names of both parties and remains in effect.

(b) If a paper copy of the order is unavailable and the officer verifies the existence and status of the order through a national or state centralized registry for protective orders or through communication with appropriate authorities in the issuing state, tribe, or territory, the officer shall enforce the order.

(c) A law enforcement officer shall make an arrest for a violation of a foreign protective order in the same manner as for violations of protective orders issued in this State. [L 2000, c 186, pt of ยง7]
