(1) Transfer the billing authority and all rights to the wireless telephone number or numbers of a shared wireless plan to a petitioner who has been granted an order for protection pursuant to this chapter if the petitioner is not the account holder of the shared wireless plan; provided that if the petitioner is not the protected party named in the order for protection, the billing authority and rights to the wireless telephone number or numbers of a shared wireless plan may be transferred to another person who shall serve as the account holder, as requested by or on behalf of the protected party with the protected party's approval; or

(2) Remove or release the petitioner from a shared wireless plan and assign a substitute telephone number or numbers; provided that if the petitioner is not the protected party named in the order for protection, the court may order that the protected party be removed or released from a shared wireless plan and assigned a substitute telephone number or numbers and order a person, as requested by or on behalf of the protected party with the protected party's approval, to be the account holder for the substitute telephone number or numbers.

(b) The order issued pursuant to subsection (a) shall be a separate order that is directed to the wireless telecommunications service provider. The order shall list the name and billing telephone number of the account holder, the name of the person to whom the telephone number or numbers will be transferred, and each telephone number to be transferred.

(c) A cause of action shall not lie against any wireless telecommunications service provider, its officers, employees, or agents for the actions taken that are related to the transfer of the billing authority and rights to the wireless telephone number or numbers in accordance with the terms of a court order issued pursuant to this section.
