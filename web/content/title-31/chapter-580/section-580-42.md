**§580-42 Irretrievable breakdown.** (a) If both of the parties by complaint or otherwise have stated under oath or affirmation that the marriage is irretrievably broken, or one of the parties has so stated and the other has not denied it, the court, after hearing, shall make a finding whether the marriage is irretrievably broken. The court, in its discretion, may waive a hearing on an uncontested divorce complaint and admit proof by affidavit.

(1) Make a finding whether the marriage is irretrievably broken, or

(2) Continue the matter for further hearing not less than thirty or more than sixty days later, or as soon thereafter as the matter may be reached on the court's calendar and may suggest to the parties that they seek counseling. At the adjourned hearing, the court shall make a finding whether the marriage is irretrievably broken. [L 1972, c 11, §3; am L 1973, c 211, §5(o); am L 1989, c 127, §2]
