**[ยง583A-203] Jurisdiction to modify determination.** Except as otherwise provided in section 583A-204, a court of this State shall not modify a child-custody determination made by a court of another state unless a court of this State has jurisdiction to make an initial determination under section 583A-201(a)(1) or (2) and:

(1) The court of the other state determines it no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under section 583A-202 or that a court of this State would be a more convenient forum under section 583A-207; or

(2) A court of this State or a court of the other state determines that the child, the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in the other state. [L 2002, c 124, pt of ยง2]
