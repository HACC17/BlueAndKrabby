**[ยง571-8.1] Qualifications; tenure; removal.** Each district family judge shall reside in the judicial circuit for which the district family judge is appointed and shall have been an attorney licensed to practice in all the courts of the State for at least five years. District family judges shall hold office for a term of six years and until their successors are appointed and qualified; provided that any district family judge may be summarily removed from office, and the district family judge's commission revoked by the supreme court whenever the supreme court deems such removal necessary for the public good or the volume of cases within the circuit is reduced to a level where the reduction of the number of district family judges within a circuit is deemed advisable.
