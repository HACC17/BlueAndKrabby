**[ยง571-46.5]** **Parenting plans.** (a) For every action that includes a contested custody of children, both parties or both parents shall develop either a mutually agreed-upon general parenting plan or separate individually-desired parenting plan, and file the plan at the outset of the action.

(b) A parenting plan may include a general outline relating to parental responsibilities and parenting time. A general parenting plan may also allow the parents to develop a more detailed agreement on an informal basis.

(c) A detailed parenting plan may include, but is not limited to, provisions relating to:

(1) Residential schedule;

(2) Holiday, birthday, and vacation planning;

(3) Parental decision-making and responsibility;

(4) Breastfeeding, if applicable;

(5) Information sharing and access;

(6) Relocation of parents;

(7) Telephone access and other means of communication;

(8) Right of first refusal procedures;

(9) Transportation; and

(10) Methods for changing or enforcing the parenting plan and for resolving disputes.

(d) If the parties cannot agree on a parenting plan, the court may:

(1) Order the parties to participate in alternative dispute resolution and in counseling with a person with professional experience in child custody or parenting issues, or with other appropriate education, unless there is a finding of family violence; and

(2) Develop and file a detailed parenting plan when requested by either of the parties or parents.

(e) The court or the parties may revise and amend the parenting plan from time to time. [L 2005, c 244, ยง1]
