**[ยง571-93] Duty to cooperate and disclose information.** (a) Both the deploying parent and other parent shall cooperate with and provide information to each other in an effort to reach a mutually agreeable resolution regarding custody of and visitation with the child.

(b) A deploying parent shall provide a copy of the deploying parent's orders to the other parent promptly before deployment. Notification to the other parent shall be made at least sixty days prior to the likely start of the deployment if known, or within ten days of the deploying parent's receipt of the deploying parent's deployment orders. If fewer than ten days' notice is received by the deploying parent, then notice shall be given immediately upon receipt of the deployment orders.

(c) The court may consider the deploying parent's timeliness in disclosing an impending deployment under this section to the other parent when making any orders under this part, unless a delay or failure to disclose was necessitated by valid military or operational security concerns.
