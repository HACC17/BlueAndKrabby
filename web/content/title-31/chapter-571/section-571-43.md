**ยง571-43 Additional remedies not pleaded.** When it appears, during the course of any trial, hearing, or proceeding, that some action or remedy other than or in addition to those indicated by the petition or other pleadings appears appropriate, the court may, provided all necessary parties consent, proceed to hear and determine forthwith the additional or other issues as though originally properly sought and pleaded.
