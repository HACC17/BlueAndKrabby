**§571-34 Criminal history record checks.** The judiciary shall develop standards to ensure the reputable and responsible character of employees of detention facilities defined in this chapter which shall include but not be limited to criminal history record checks. All employees and applicants for employment at facilities established under section 571-33 shall be subject to criminal history record checks and shall provide consent to the judiciary to obtain other criminal history record information for verification. The judiciary shall obtain criminal history record information through the Hawaii criminal justice data center on all employees and applicants. The judiciary may terminate an employee or deny employment to an applicant who was convicted of a crime and if the judiciary finds that the criminal history record indicates that the employee or applicant poses a risk to the health, safety, security, or well-being of youths under detention.
