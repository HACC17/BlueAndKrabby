**[ยง571-48.6] Earned discharge from probation; reporting requirements.** (a) A child placed on probation pursuant to section 571-48(1)(A) shall be eligible to receive earned discharge credits to reduce the length of the probation term. Earned discharge credits shall reduce the term of probation by thirty days for each calendar month of compliance with the rules and conditions of probation.

(b) A child is deemed to be compliant with the rules and conditions of probation, and shall be awarded earned discharge credits for the month, if there was no violation of rules and conditions of probation that month at a level that would warrant the filing of a petition or violation report. The court, at the request of the probation officer or on its own motion, may award discharge credits to children who have demonstrated substantial compliance with the rules and conditions of probation.

(c) The judiciary shall adopt guidelines and procedures for the awarding of earned credits for discharge from probation.

(d) Each administrator of the juvenile client services branch in each judicial circuit shall annually provide to the board of family court judges and the Hawaii juvenile justice state advisory council, the number and per cent of youth who received earned discharge credits and the number of credits earned by each youth.
