**§571-74** **Rules and standards; investigation and questioning; fingerprinting and photographing.** The judges of the family courts shall make such rules and set up such standards of investigation and questioning as they consider necessary to guide and control the police, within their respective jurisdictions, in the handling of cases involving minors coming within provisions of this chapter. The rules and standards may include limitations and restrictions concerning the fingerprinting and photographing of any child in police custody, except that when any child of the age of twelve years or older who comes within section 571-11(1) is taken into custody for committing an act which, if committed by an adult would be a felony, a misdemeanor, or a petty misdemeanor any limitation or restriction concerning fingerprinting shall not apply. The police shall report all police designated fields of information collected on juvenile offenders to the juvenile justice information system. The rules shall be enforceable as orders of the court.
