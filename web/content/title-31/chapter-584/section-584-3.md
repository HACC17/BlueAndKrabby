**[ยง584-3] How parent and child relationship established.** The parent and child relationship between a child and:

(1) The natural mother may be established by proof of her having given birth to the child, or under this chapter;

(2) The natural father may be established under this chapter;

(3) An adoptive parent may be established by proof of adoption. [L 1975, c 66, pt of ยง1]

Case Notes

By their plain language, ยง584-1 and this section do not state that this chapter is the exclusive means by which paternity must be established; thus, this chapter is not the exclusive means by which a determination of paternity can be made. 99 H. 1, 52 P.3d 255.
