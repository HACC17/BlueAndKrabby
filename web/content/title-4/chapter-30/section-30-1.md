**[ยง30-1] Declaration of purpose.** The legislature declares it to be the purpose of this chapter to promote the orderly transfer of the executive power in connection with the expiration of the term of office of a governor and the inauguration of a new governor. The interest of the State requires that such transitions be accomplished so as to assure continuity in the conduct of the affairs of the state government. Any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could produce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the State and its people. Accordingly, it is the intent of the legislature that appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or minimize any disruption. In addition to the specific provisions contained in this chapter directed toward that purpose, it is the intent of the legislature that all officers of the state government so conduct the affairs of the state government for which they exercise responsibility and authority as (1) to be mindful of problems occasioned by transitions in the office of governor, (2) to take appropriate lawful steps to avoid or minimize disruptions that might be occasioned by the transfer of the executive power, and (3) otherwise to promote orderly transitions in the office of governor.
