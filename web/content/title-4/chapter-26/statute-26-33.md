**ยง26-33 Performance of duties of vacant office.** In the event of a vacancy in any office for which the governor has the power of appointment or nomination, the governor may designate some other officer or employee of the State to perform the duties of the vacant office until the office is filled. The authority derived from this section shall not continue for a longer period than sixty days after the vacancy occurs.

An officer or employee designated to perform the duties of a vacant office shall, so long as the authority continues, receive the compensation attached to the vacant office, or the compensation attached to the officer's or employee's regular office or employment, whichever is the higher.
