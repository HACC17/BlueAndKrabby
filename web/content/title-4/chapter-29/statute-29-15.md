**§29-15 Conflict between federal and state requirements.** In the case of any contract, the funds for which have been wholly or in part promised, loaned, or furnished by the United States, or any instrumentality thereof, if the United States, or its instrumentality, requires that the advertisement for tenders, tenders, performance bond, or contract contain terms or provisions contrary to any state law, then as to the advertisements, tenders, bonds, or contracts the terms and provisions required by the United States, or its instrumentality, shall govern and are made applicable, and the officer expending the funds shall conform to such requirements as the United States, or its instrumentality, shall provide or require, any other law or laws of the State to the contrary notwithstanding. The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed so as not to hinder or impede the State in contracting for any project involving financial aid from the federal government. [L 1935, c 50, §1; RL 1945, §403; RL 1955, §12-5; HRS §29-15]
