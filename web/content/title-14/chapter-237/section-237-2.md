**§237-2 "Business", "engaging" in business, defined.** "Business" as used in this chapter, includes all activities (personal, professional, or corporate), engaged in or caused to be engaged in with the object of gain or economic benefit either direct or indirect, but does not include casual sales.

The term "engaging" as used in this chapter with reference to engaging or continuing in business also includes the exercise of corporate or franchise powers. [L 1935, c 141, pt of §1; RL 1945, §5443; RL 1955, §117-2; [HRS §237-2](/title-14/chapter-237/section-237-2/)]

Co-op apartment corporation operating and managing apartment building is engaged in business and is taxable on its receipts of monthly "maintenance" charges from stockholder-lessees. Att. Gen. Op. 62-47.

Application of excise tax to activities in foreign trade zone. Att. Gen. Op. 64-52.

Taxability of transactions between joint venture and its member. 59 H. 307, 582 P.2d 703.

Where taxpayer gained or economically benefited from subleasing transactions, the director's assessment and imposition of the general excise tax for taxpayer's subleasing activities was proper. 110 H. 25, 129 P.3d 528 (2006).
