**§237-33 Annual return, payment of tax.** On or before the twentieth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year, each taxpayer shall make a return showing the value of products, gross proceeds of sales or gross income, and compute the amount of tax chargeable against the taxpayer in accordance with this chapter and deduct the amount of monthly payments (as hereinbefore provided), and transmit with the taxpayer's report a remittance in the form required by section 237-31 covering the residue of the tax chargeable against the taxpayer to the district office of the department of taxation hereinafter designated. The return shall be signed by the taxpayer, if made by an individual, or by the president, vice-president, secretary, or treasurer of a corporation, if made on behalf of a corporation. If made on behalf of a partnership, firm, society, unincorporated association, group, hui, joint adventure, joint stock company, corporation, trust estate, decedent's estate, trust, or other entity, any individual delegated by the entity shall sign the same on behalf of the taxpayer. If for any reason it is not practicable for the individual taxpayer to sign the return, it may be done by any duly authorized agent. The department, for good cause shown, may extend the time for making the return on the application of any taxpayer and grant such reasonable additional time within which to make the same as may, by it, be deemed advisable.

Section 232-2 applies to the annual return, but not to a monthly return.
