**§237-46 Collection by suit; injunction.** The department of taxation may collect taxes due and unpaid under this chapter, together with all accrued penalties, by action in assumpsit or other appropriate proceedings in the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the privilege taxed has been exercised. After delinquency shall have continued for sixty days, or if any person lawfully required so to do under this chapter shall fail to apply for and secure a license as provided by this chapter for a period of sixty days after the first date when the person was required under this chapter to secure the same, the department may proceed in the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the privilege taxed or taxable has been exercised, to obtain an injunction restraining the further exercise of the privilege until full payment shall have been made of all taxes and penalties and interest due under this chapter, or until such license is secured, or both, as the circumstances of the case may require.
