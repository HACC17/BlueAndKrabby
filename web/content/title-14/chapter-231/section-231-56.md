**[ยง231-56] Charges for setoff; credit to agency.** The State may charge the claimant agency for the cost of the setoff; provided that the charges shall not exceed the proceeds of the collection. The State may designate a single percentage to be retained from the proceeds of the setoff as a charge for cost of assistance. The net proceeds of a setoff, after deduction of any charge, shall be credited to the claimant agency's account or fund. [L 1982, c 199, pt of ยง1]
