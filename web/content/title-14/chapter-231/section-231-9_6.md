**[§231-9.6] Fiduciaries, liability.** Every personal representative, trustee, guardian, or other fiduciary shall be answerable as such for the performance of all acts, matters, or things as are required to be done in respect to the assessment of the taxes for which the fiduciary is responsible in a fiduciary capacity. The fiduciary shall be liable for the payment of those taxes up to the amount of the available property held by the fiduciary, but shall not be personally liable. The fiduciary may retain so much property as may be necessary to pay the taxes due. The fiduciary may recover the amount of taxes paid from the beneficiary to whom the property shall have been distributed. [L 1989, c 14, §1(3)]
