**§231-28 Tax clearance before procuring liquor licenses.** No liquor licenses shall be issued or renewed unless the applicant therefor shall present to the issuing agency, a certificate signed by the director of taxation, showing that the applicant does not owe the State any delinquent taxes, penalties, or interest; or that the applicant has entered into and is complying with an installment plan agreement with the department of taxation for the payment of delinquent taxes in installments. [L 1949, c 352, §1; RL 1955, §115-33; am L 1963, c 82, §1; am L 1964, c 6, §2; [HRS §231-28](/title-14/chapter-231/section-231-28/); am L 2009, c 184, §1]

Attorney General Opinions

Taxpayer's agreement to pay its delinquent taxes, pursuant to a payment schedule, does not satisfy the requirements for liquor license renewal under this section and §281-45\. Att. Gen. Op. 95-1.
