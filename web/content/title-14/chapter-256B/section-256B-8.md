**[ยง256B-8] Hawaii ABLE savings program trust fund.** (a) There is established the Hawaii ABLE savings program trust fund within the treasury of the State. The fund shall consist of moneys received from an ABLE savings program manager, any governmental or private grants, and any general fund appropriations for the program.

(b) The fund shall be used if the director elects to accept deposits from contributors, rather than have deposits sent directly to the program manager. The fund shall consist of any moneys deposited by contributors in accordance with this chapter which are not deposited directly with the program manager.

(c) All interest derived from the deposit and investment of moneys in the savings program trust fund shall be credited to the fund. At the end of any fiscal year, all unexpended and unencumbered moneys in the savings program trust fund shall remain in the savings program trust fund and shall not be credited or transferred to the general fund or any other funds.

(d) All expenses incurred by the director in developing and administering the ABLE savings program shall be payable from the Hawaii ABLE savings program trust fund. [L 2015, c 206, pt of ยง2]
