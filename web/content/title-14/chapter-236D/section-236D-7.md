**ยง236D-7 Interest on amount due; extension of time to file federal return.** (a) Any tax due under this chapter which is not paid by the time prescribed for the filing of the report as provided in section 236D-5, not including any extension in respect to the filing of the report or the payment of the tax, shall bear interest at the rate in section 231-39(b)(4) from the date any tax is due until paid.

(b) If the report provided for in section 236D-5 is not filed within the time periods specified, then there shall be paid, in addition to the interest provided in this section, a penalty equal to five per cent of the tax due in respect to the transfer or generation-skipping transfer for each month beyond the time periods that the report has not been filed, but no penalty so imposed shall exceed a total of twenty-five per cent of the tax.

(c) If the person required to pay the tax has obtained an extension of time for payment of the federal tax, the person may elect to extend the time for payment of the tax due under this chapter in accordance with the extension. The election shall be made by filing a true copy of the extension of time for payment with the report and the returns required under section 236D-5\. [L 1983, c 217, pt of ยง1; am L 1994, c 142, ยง6]
