**§237D-14 Collection by suit; injunction.** The department may collect taxes due and unpaid under this chapter, together with all accrued penalties, by action in assumpsit or other appropriate proceedings in the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the taxes arose. After delinquency shall have continued for sixty days, or if any person lawfully required so to do under this chapter shall fail to apply for and secure a certificate as provided by this chapter for a period of sixty days after the first date when the person was required under this chapter to secure the certificate, the department may proceed in the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the transient accommodations or in which occupants of resort time share vacation units are taxed, to obtain an injunction restraining the further furnishing of transient accommodations or the operation of the resort time share vacation plan until full payment shall have been made of all taxes and penalties and interest due under this chapter, or until such certificate is secured, or both, as the circumstances of the case may require.
