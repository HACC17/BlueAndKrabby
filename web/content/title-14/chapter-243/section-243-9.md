(1) The total number of gallons of fuel refined, manufactured, produced, or compounded by the distributor and sold or used by the distributor, and if for ultimate use in another county or on either island, the name of that county or island;

(2) The total number of gallons of such fuel imported by the distributor, or acquired by the distributor from persons not licensed distributors, and sold or used by the distributor, and if for ultimate use in another county or on either island, the name of that county or island; and

(3) The total number of gallons of such fuel sold to the United States or any department or agency thereof or to any other person or entity, or used in any manner, the effect of which sale or use is to exempt the fuel so sold or used from the imposition of the tax provided for by this chapter.
