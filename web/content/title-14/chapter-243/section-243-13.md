**§243-13 Director empowered to make examinations, penalty, etc.** The director of taxation and the director's authorized assistants may subpoena witnesses, compel the production of books, papers, and other records, administer oaths, examine books and records, and hear and take such evidence in relation to any matters within the director's jurisdiction, and upon which it is necessary or proper that the director be informed, under this chapter, as in the director's discretion the director may deem proper. The circuit courts shall have power, upon request of the director or any such assistant, to enforce by proper contempt proceedings the attendance of witnesses and the giving of testimony by them, and the production of books, papers, and records. False swearing under oath as to any material fact at any hearing held under this section shall be subject to chapter 710, part V. If the examination discloses that any reports of distributors or other persons theretofore filed with the director by the distributors or other persons, pursuant to the requirements of this chapter, have shown incorrectly the number of gallons of fuel sold or used, or the tax accruing thereon, so that any additional license taxes are due and payable under this chapter, the director shall proceed to collect such unpaid license taxes.
