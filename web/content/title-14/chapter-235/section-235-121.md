"Internal Revenue Code" has the meaning set forth in section 235-2.3 and as it applies to the taxable period; section references of the Internal Revenue Code shall be deemed to refer to corresponding provisions of prior and subsequent federal tax laws.

"Post-termination transition period" means that period defined in section 1377(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code.

"Pro rata share" means the share determined with respect to an S corporation shareholder for a taxable period in the manner provided in section 1377(a)(1) or (2) or 1362(e)(2) or (3) or (6)(D), as the case may be, of the Internal Revenue Code.

Due consideration shall be given in the interpretation of this part to applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code in effect from time to time and to federal rulings and regulations interpreting those sections, provided the Internal Revenue Code rulings and regulations do not conflict with this part or other provisions of this chapter.

(d) This part shall be applied and construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject matter of this part among states enacting it. [L 1990, c 16, pt of ยง1]
