**§235-95 Partnership returns.** Every partnership shall make a return for each taxable year upon forms prescribed by the department of taxation, itemizing its gross income and allowable deductions and including the names and addresses of the persons who would be entitled to share in the income if distributed and the amount of each distributive share. The return shall be authenticated by the signature of any one of the partners, under the penalties provided by section 231-36, and the fact that a partner's name is signed on the return shall be prima facie evidence that such partner is authorized to sign the return on behalf of the partnership. All provisions of this chapter relating to returns shall be applicable to partnership returns except as specifically otherwise stated in this section.
