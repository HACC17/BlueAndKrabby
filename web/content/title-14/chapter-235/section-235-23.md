**ยง235-23 Taxable in another state.** For purposes of allocation and apportionment of income under this part, a taxpayer is taxable in another state if:

(1) In that state the taxpayer is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax measured by net income, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business, or a corporate stock tax, or

(2) That state has jurisdiction to subject the taxpayer to a net income tax regardless of whether, in fact, the state does or does not. [L 1967, c 33, pt of ยง1; [HRS ยง235-23](/title-14/chapter-235/section-235-23/); gen ch 1985]
