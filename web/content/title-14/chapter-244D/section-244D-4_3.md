(b) For the purposes of this section, the manufacturer, producer, or seller shall take from the purchaser, a certificate, in such form as the department shall prescribe, certifying that the liquor purchased is to be resold or otherwise consumed or used outside the State. Any purchaser who shall furnish such a certificate shall be obligated to pay to the seller, upon demand, if the liquor purchased is not resold or otherwise consumed or used outside the State, the amount of the additional tax which by reason thereof is imposed upon the seller.
