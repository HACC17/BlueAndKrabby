**ยง244D-9 Records to be kept.** (a) Every dealer shall keep a record of all sales of liquor by gallonage and dollar volume in each liquor category defined in section 244D-1 and taxed under section 244D-4(a) made by the dealer, in such form as the department of taxation may prescribe. Every person holding a license under the liquor law, other than a manufacturer's or wholesaler's license, shall keep a record of all purchases by the person of liquor by gallonage and dollar volume in each liquor category defined in section 244D-1 and taxed under section 244D-4(a), in such form as the department may prescribe. All such records shall be offered for inspection and examination at any time upon demand by the department or commission and shall be preserved for a period of five years, except that the department may in writing consent to their destruction within such period or may require that they be kept longer.

The department may by rule require the dealer to keep such other records as it may deem necessary for the proper enforcement of this chapter.

(b) If any dealer or any other taxpayer fails to keep records from which a proper determination of the tax due under this chapter may be made, the department may fix the amount of tax for any period from the best information obtainable by it, and assess the tax as hereinbefore provided.
