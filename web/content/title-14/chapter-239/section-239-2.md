(5) With respect to a home service provider of mobile telecommunications services, "gross income" includes charges billed for mobile telecommunications services provided by a home service provider to a customer with a place of primary use in this State when the mobile telecommunications services originate and terminate within the same state; provided that all such charges for mobile telecommunications services that are billed by or for the home service provider are deemed to be provided by the home service provider at the customer's place of primary use, regardless of where the mobile telecommunications services originate, terminate, or pass through. "Gross income" shall not include:

(A) Any charges for or receipts from mobile telecommunications services provided to customers of the home service provider whose place of primary use is outside this State;

(B) Any receipts of a home service provider acting as a serving carrier providing mobile telecommunications services to another home service provider's customer; and

(C) Any receipts specifically from interstate or foreign mobile telecommunications services taxable under section 237-13(6)(D), as determined by the home service provider's books and records kept in the ordinary course of business.

For the purposes of this paragraph, "customer", "home service provider", "mobile telecommunications services", "place of primary use", and "serving carrier" have the same meaning as in section 239-22.

The words "gross income" and "gross income from public service company business" shall not be construed to include dividends (as defined by section 235-1) paid by one member of an affiliated public service company group to another member of the same group; or gross income from the sale or transfer of materials or supplies, interest on loans, or the provision of engineering, construction, maintenance, or managerial services by one member of an affiliated public service company group to another member of the same group.

"Member of an affiliated public service company group" means a corporation (including the parent corporation) that is included within an affiliated public service company group.

Where the transportation of passengers or property is furnished through arrangements between motor carriers, and the gross income is divided between the motor carriers, any tax imposed by this chapter shall apply to each motor carrier with respect to each motor carrier's respective portion of the proceeds.

Where tourism related services are furnished through arrangements made by a travel agency or tour packager and the gross income is divided between the provider of the services on the one hand and the travel agency or tour packager on the other hand, any tax imposed by this chapter shall apply to each person with respect to each person's respective portion of the proceeds.

Accounts found to be worthless and actually charged off for income tax purposes, at corresponding periods, may be deducted from gross income as specified under this chapter so far as the accounts reflect taxable sales, but shall be added to gross income when and if subsequently collected.

The "net operating income" of a public utility subject to the tax rate imposed by section 239-5(a) is the operating revenues less the operating expenses and tax accruals, including in the computation of such revenues and expenses, debits and credits arising from equipment rents and joint facility rents. In the event that, but for this sentence, deductions could not be had for expenses of services because such services were rendered by the same person or persons constituting the public utility or could not be had for income taxes, because such taxes were levied against the person or persons constituting the public utility in the person's or their individual capacity and not as a separate entity, there nevertheless shall be allowed as deductions in computing the net operating income (A) a reasonable allowance for the value of personal services actually rendered, and (B) such proportion of the actual amount of income taxes, federal and state, as fairly represents the portion of the income so taxed which was derived from the public utility business.
