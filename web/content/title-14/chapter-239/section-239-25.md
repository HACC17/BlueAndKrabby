**[ยง239-25] Nonseverability.** If a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final judgment on the merits that:

(1) Is based on federal law;

(2) Is no longer subject to appeal; and

(3) Substantially limits or impairs the essential elements of sections 239-21 to 239-24,

then sections 239-21 to 239-24 are invalid and have no legal effect as of the date of entry of the judgment. [L 2002, c 209, pt of ยง2]
