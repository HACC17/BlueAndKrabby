The cost of such borrowing, including without limitation all principal, interest, commitment fees, and other expenses payable with respect to such borrowing, shall be a common expense of the project; provided that owners representing fifty per cent of the common interest and apartments give written consent to such borrowing, having been first notified of the purpose and use of the funds.
