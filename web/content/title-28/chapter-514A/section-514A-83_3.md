**ยง514A-83.3 Membership list.** The resident manager or managing agent or board of directors shall keep an accurate and current list of members of the association of apartment owners and their current addresses and the names and addresses of the vendees under an agreement of sale, if any. The list shall be maintained at a place designated by the board of directors and a copy shall be available, at cost, to any member of the association as provided in the declaration or bylaws or rules and regulations or, in any case, to any member who furnishes to the resident manager or managing agent or board of directors a duly executed and acknowledged affidavit stating that the list:

(1) Shall be used by such owner personally and only for the purpose of soliciting votes or proxies or providing information to other owners with respect to association matters, and

(2) Shall not be used by such owner or furnished to anyone else for any other purpose.

No board of directors shall adopt any rule prohibiting the solicitation of proxies or distribution of materials relating to association matters on the common elements by apartment owners; provided that a board of directors may adopt rules regulating reasonable time, place, and manner of such solicitations or distributions, or both. A board of directors may prohibit commercial solicitations. [L 2007, c 244, pt of ยง2]
