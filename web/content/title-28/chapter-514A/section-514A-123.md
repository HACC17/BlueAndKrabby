**ยง514A-123 Determination of insurance coverage.** In the event of a dispute as to whether a claim shall be excluded from mandatory arbitration under section 514A-121(b)(7), any party to an arbitration may file a complaint for declaratory relief against the involved insurer or insurers for a determination of whether insurance coverage is unavailable due to the pursuit of action by arbitration. The complaint shall be filed with the circuit court in the judicial circuit in which the condominium is located. The insurer or insurers shall file an answer to the complaint within twenty days of the date of service of the complaint and the issue shall be disposed of by the circuit court at a hearing to be held at the earliest available date; provided that the hearing shall not be held within twenty days from the date of service of the complaint upon the insurer or insurers.
