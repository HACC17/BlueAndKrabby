**ยง514A-82.5 Pets in apartments.** (a) Whenever the bylaws do not forbid apartment owners from keeping animals as pets in their apartments, the bylaws shall not forbid the tenants of the apartment owners from keeping pets in the apartments rented or leased from the owners; provided that:

(1) The apartment owner agrees in writing to allow the apartment owner's tenant to keep a pet in the apartment;

(2) The tenants may keep only those types of pets which may be kept by apartment owners;

(3) The bylaws may allow each owner or tenant to keep only one pet in the apartment;

(4) The animals shall not include those described as pests under section 150A-2, or animals prohibited from importation under section 141-2, 150A-5, or 150A-6;

(5) The bylaws may include reasonable restrictions or prohibitions against excessive noise or other problems caused by pets on the property; and

(6) The bylaws may reasonably restrict or prohibit the running of pets at large in the common areas of the property.

(b) Any amendments to the bylaws pertaining to pet restrictions or prohibitions which exempt circumstances existing prior to the adoption of the amendments shall apply equally to apartment owners and tenants. [L 2007, c 244, pt of ยง2]
