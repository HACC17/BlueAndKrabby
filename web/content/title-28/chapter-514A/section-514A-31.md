**§514A-31 Notification of intention.** (a) Prior to the time when apartments in a condominium project are to be offered for sale in this State, the developer shall register the project with the commission by notifying the commission in writing of the developer's intention to sell such apartments. No offer of sale or sale shall be made until the project has been registered with the commission and the commission has issued an effective date for the project's preliminary, contingent final, or final public report.

(b) Prior to the time when a developer offers or proposes to offer for sale a time share plan located in a condominium project where apartments are being offered or proposed to be offered for sale for the first time to the public, the developer shall register the project with the commission and obtain an effective date for the developer's public report; provided that the developer shall not be required to deliver to a prospective purchaser or purchaser a true copy of the developer's public report or disclosure abstract, as required by this chapter, when a time share plan is duly registered under chapter 514E if, with regard to that time share project:

(1) A copy of the disclosure statement required by chapter 514E is required to be delivered to the purchaser or prospective purchaser; or

(2) Pursuant to section 514E-30, a copy of the disclosure statement required by chapter 514E is not required to be delivered to the purchaser or prospective purchaser because the offer and sale of the time share interest is made outside of Hawaii.
