**[ยง524-2] Facility advisory body.** The board of directors or other governing body of each facility shall create an advisory body composed of residents of the State, and at least two members, or twenty-five per cent, whichever is greater, shall be lessees of the facility. At least one lessee member of the facility shall be a member of any committee or subcommittee of the advisory body.

The governing body of the facility shall organize the advisory body and shall appoint the facility lessee members from a list submitted by the lessees of the facility, comprised of at least two names for every position available for lessee members on the advisory body. The advisory body shall thereafter organize itself and shall make rules and bylaws as may be necessary for it to function, provided the rules and bylaws are consistent with the directives of the facility governing body.

The advisory body shall submit recommendations concerning the operation and management of the facility in writing to the facility governing body for its consideration. [L 1979, c 2, pt of ยง2]
