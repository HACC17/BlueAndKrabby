**[ยง514E-7] Maintenance charges.** If time share units, or transient vacation rentals are located in the same project as private residential units, charges for the maintenance of common elements assessed against time share and transient vacation rental units may exceed the charges assessed against other units by as much as fifty per cent; provided that such charges do not exceed those assessed against units in the project accommodating transient vacationers with stays of thirty days or less, and such charges are in proportion to extra maintenance expenses actually attributable to the time share and transient vacation rental units. [L 1980, c 186, pt of ยง1]
