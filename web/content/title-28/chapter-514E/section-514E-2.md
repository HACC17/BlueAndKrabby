**ยง514E-2 Status of property.** (a) The temporal division of any interest in real property shall not, in and of itself, affect its status as real property.

(b) Whether a time share plan is a time share ownership plan or time share use plan, for purposes of chapter 467 a time share interest shall constitute "real estate" and the offer or sale thereof shall constitute the offer or sale of an interest in real property.
