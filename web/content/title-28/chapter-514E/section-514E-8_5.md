**[ยง514E-8.5]** **Classes of time share interests.** (a) A time share plan may establish classes of time share interests defined by characteristics as the developer shall determine, including but not limited to season, unit size, location, view, or otherwise.

(b) If one or more of the time share units will not be available for the entire duration of the time share plan then, in addition to other characteristics as the developer shall determine, the time share interests shall be classified by duration. [L 1997, c 372, pt of ยง1]
