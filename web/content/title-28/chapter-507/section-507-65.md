(D) That the stored property is subject to a lien and the amount of the lien.

(E) That the property will be sold to satisfy the lien after a specified date which is not less than thirty days from the date of mailing the notice unless prior to the specified date, the lien is paid in full.

(F) That any excess proceeds of the sale over the lien amount of costs of sale will be retained by the owner and may be reclaimed by the occupant, or claimed by another person, at any time for a period of one year from the sale and that thereafter the proceeds will go to the State under chapter 523A.

(G) That if the proceeds of sale do not fully cover the amount of lien and costs, the occupant will be held liable for any deficiency.
