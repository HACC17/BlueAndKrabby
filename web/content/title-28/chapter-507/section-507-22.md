**§507-22 Disputes as to application of proceeds of sale upon execution; jurisdiction of district courts; appeal.** Where a dispute arises as to the application of the proceeds upon the sale under execution of property held by a lienor, the court shall order that the proceeds be paid into court. It shall thereupon determine to or among whom the proceeds shall be paid or divided. Nothing in section 604-5, limiting the jurisdiction of district courts, shall be construed as affecting the adjudication; but an appeal may be taken therefrom as in other civil cases.
