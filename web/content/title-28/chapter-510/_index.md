Note

By virtue of L 1945, c 273, the community property system was in effect in the State from 1945 to 1949\. The system was abolished by L 1949, c 242\. Community property established during 1945 to 1949 is governed by this chapter.

L 1949, c 242, §1, repealed §§1-4 of L 1945, c 273, but provided that established interests in property should not be divested. The repealed sections defined separate property and community property. Upheld as constitutional in classifying as community property the income from separate property held before marriage. 41 H. 578.

See L 1949, c 242, §2, providing that income of community property held when community dissolved by that act shall be held as community property.

Effect of repeal, see 198 F. Supp. 78, 87, aff'd 304 F.2d 149.

Payment of federal tax constituting a lien when community property law went into effect, held authorized use of community income while community estate continued. 41 H. 578, 588.

Prior to 1949, §510-1 provided that property acquired after the commencement of the community presumed to be community property. Applied in 41 H. 578, 590; 246 F.2d 204, 206; see 277 F.2d 806.
