**[ยง523A-17] Election to take payment or delivery.** (a) The administrator may decline to receive property reported under this part that the administrator considers to have a value less than the expenses of notice and sale.

(b) A holder, with the written consent of the administrator and upon conditions and terms prescribed by the administrator, may report and deliver property before the property is presumed abandoned. Property so delivered shall be held by the administrator and shall not be presumed abandoned until it otherwise would be presumed abandoned under this part. [L 2008, c 55, pt of ยง1]
