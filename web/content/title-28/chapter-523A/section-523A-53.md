If the last known address of an owner is in this State, any other owner's address which is unknown shall be presumed to be in this State. If the last known addresses of owners are in this State and in one or more other states, the addresses of other owners whose addresses are unknown shall be presumed to be within this State if the federal agency or instrumentality having custody of the unclaimed property initially acquired possession in this State or if the federal agency or instrumentality possessing, holding, controlling, or owning such property is a corporation domiciled in this State. If the records of any officer, department, or agency of the United States do not disclose the address of any owner of unclaimed property, such address shall be presumed to be within this State if the federal agency having custody of the unclaimed property initially acquired possession in this State or is a corporation domiciled in this State. All addresses presumed to be within this State are presumed to be within the city and county of Honolulu. For the purpose of this part, it shall be presumed that the situs of intangible unclaimed property is in this State if the last known or presumed address of the owner is in this State.

(b) All tangible unclaimed property is subject to delivery in this State if the federal agency having custody of the unclaimed property initially acquired possession in this State. [L 1988, c 93, pt of ยง2]
