**[ยง523A-16] Action to establish claim.** A person, excluding another state, aggrieved by a decision of the administrator or whose claim has not been acted upon within one hundred twenty days after its filing may maintain an original action to establish the claim in the circuit court, naming the administrator as a defendant. If the aggrieved person establishes the claim in an action against the administrator, the court may award the claimant reasonable attorney's fees. [L 2008, c 55, pt of ยง1]
