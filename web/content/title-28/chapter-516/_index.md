Case Notes

Chapter did not preempt ordinance relating to residential condominium leasehold conversion. 76 H. 46, 868 P.2d 1193.

Chapter only authorizes housing finance and development corporation to institute single condemnation proceeding of a specifically designated portion of a development tract and does not allow that proceeding to be judicially divided into multiple condemnations of individual lots. 82 H. 172, 921 P.2d 92.

**Constitutionality.**

Chapter did not violate "public use" requirement of Fifth Amendment to U.S. Constitution. 467 U.S. 229.

Hawaii Land Reform Act violates public use limitation of Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of U.S. Constitution. 702 F.2d 788.

Given system of landholding in Hawaii, legislature could, under police power, conclude that general welfare was served by condemning land of large landholder-lessors and allow lessees to purchase land from State. 483 F. Supp. 63.

Legislature's determinations of what land is subject to condemnation and who is entitled to repurchase from State are not arbitrary or capricious. 483 F. Supp. 63.

Condemnation of leased fee interests in residential houselots continued to satisfy "public use" prerequisite of Fifth Amendment to U.S. Constitution and article I, §20 of Hawaii constitution. 79 H. 64, 898 P.2d 576.
