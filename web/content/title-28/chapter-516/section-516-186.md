The fee title acquisition loan programs authorized under this part may be undertaken, and revenue bonds may be issued under this part, notwithstanding that any other law may provide for a loan program similar to that authorized under this part, and may be undertaken for the issuance of bonds for like purposes, and without regard to the requirements, restrictions, limitations, or other provisions contained in any other law. Insofar as the provisions of this part are inconsistent with the provisions of any other law, this part shall be controlling. [L 1983, c 270, pt of §1]
