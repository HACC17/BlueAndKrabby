(1) Repurchase of the loans, in whole or in part, by mortgage lenders at the option of the corporation;

(2) Payments of premiums, fees, charges, or other amounts by mortgage lenders to provide a reserve or escrow fund for the purposes of protecting against loan defaults; and

(3) Guarantee by, or for recourse against, mortgage lenders, with respect to defaults on these loans of the corporation.
