**[ยง501-248] Jurisdiction for matters pertaining to leasehold time share interests.** The land court shall have jurisdiction over all matters relating to instruments required by this part to be registered pursuant to this chapter. Where any party is in doubt as to whether an instrument must be registered, the question shall be referred to the land court for decision; and the court, after notice to all parties and a hearing, shall enter an order determining the question. Except as expressly otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this part shall deprive the land court of exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to section 501-101 over registered land, or any interest therein, which is prior or superior to the interest of the lessee of a leasehold time share interest. The circuit court shall have jurisdiction, pursuant to section [603-21.5(a)(3)], over:

(1) All matters relating to instruments required by this part to be recorded pursuant to chapter 502;

(2) All other matters pertaining to a leasehold time share interest (except those in which jurisdiction is vested in the land court pursuant to this section); and

(3) All matters as to which jurisdiction would otherwise lie in the land court in part and in the circuit court in part. [L 1998, c 219, pt of ยง1]
