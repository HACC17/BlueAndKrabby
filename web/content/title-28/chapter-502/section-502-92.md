**§502-92 Copies of old records.** The registrar shall prepare photographic, electronic, or electrostatic copies of the records and record books in the bureau of conveyances which by reason of age, usage, or otherwise are in such condition that they can no longer be conveniently used or consulted without danger of destruction thereof, and certify to the correctness of such copies. The certified copies, and prints made from them and similarly certified, may be read in evidence with the same force and effect as the original instrument. The correctness of such copies is not conclusive but may be rebutted. All such records and record books from which the copies are made shall be deposited with the department of accounting and general services in its public archives. The registrar may convert into electronic form information or documents recorded before the registrar was given the authority to record electronic documents.
