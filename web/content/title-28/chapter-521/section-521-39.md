**[ยง521-39] Medical marijuana; tenant use; eviction.** A provision in a rental agreement allowing for eviction of a tenant who has a valid certificate for the medical use of marijuana as provided in section 329-123 in any form is void, unless the rental agreement allows for eviction for smoking tobacco and the medical marijuana is used by means of smoking; provided that this section shall not apply where the articles of incorporation, declaration, bylaws, administrative rules, house rules, association documents, or a similar document of a condominium property regime or planned community association prohibits the medical use of marijuana.
