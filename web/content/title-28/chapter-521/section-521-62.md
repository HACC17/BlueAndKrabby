**[ยง521-62] Tenant's remedy of termination at beginning of term.** If the landlord fails to conform to the rental agreement, or is in material noncompliance with section 521-42(a), the tenant may, on notice to the landlord, terminate the rental agreement and vacate the dwelling unit at any time during the first week of occupancy. The tenant shall retain such right to terminate beyond the first week of occupancy so long as the tenant remains in possession in reliance on a promise, whether written or oral, by the landlord to correct all or any part of the condition which would justify termination by the tenant under this section. [L 1972, c 132, pt of ยง1; gen ch 1985]
