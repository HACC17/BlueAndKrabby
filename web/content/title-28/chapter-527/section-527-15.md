**[ยง527-****15] Liability for creditor claims and statutory allowances.** (a) To the extent the transferor's probate estate is insufficient to satisfy an allowed claim against the estate or a statutory allowance to a surviving spouse or child, the estate may enforce the liability against the subject property transferred at the transferor's death by a transfer on death deed.

(b) If more than one property is transferred by one or more transfer on death deeds, the liability under subsection (a) shall be apportioned among the subject properties in proportion to their respective net values at the time of the transferor's death.

(c) A proceeding to enforce liability under this section shall be commenced not later than eighteen months after the transferor's death. [L 2011, c 173, pt of ยง1]
