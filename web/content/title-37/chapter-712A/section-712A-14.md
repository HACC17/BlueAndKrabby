**[§712A-14]** **Supplemental remedies.** (1) The court shall order the forfeiture of any other property of an in personam civil or criminal defendant up to the value of the subject property if any of the property subject to forfeiture:

(a) Cannot be located;

(b) Has been transferred or conveyed to, sold to, or deposited with a third party;

(c) Has been placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court;

(d) Has been substantially diminished in value by any act or omission of a defendant, or a defendant's agent or assignee; or

(e) Has been commingled with other property which cannot be divided without difficulty.

(2) In addition to any other remedy provided for by law, if property subject to forfeiture is conveyed, alienated, disposed of, or otherwise rendered unavailable for forfeiture after the filing of a racketeering lien notice or provision of notice of pending forfeiture or after the filing and notice of a civil proceeding or criminal proceeding alleging forfeiture under this chapter, whichever is earlier, the State or seizing agency, on behalf of the State, may institute an action in circuit court against the person named in the racketeering lien or notice of pending forfeiture or the defendant in the civil proceeding or criminal proceeding, and the court shall enter final judgment against the person named in the racketeering lien or notice of pending forfeiture or the defendant in the civil proceeding or criminal proceeding in an amount equal to the fair market value of the property, together with reasonable investigative expenses and attorney fees. If a civil proceeding is pending, such action shall be filed only in the court where the civil proceeding is pending.

(3) This section does not limit the right of the State to obtain any order or injunction, receivership, writ, attachment, garnishment, or other remedy authorized under this chapter or appropriate to protect the interests of the State or available under other applicable law.
