COMMENTARY ON §712-1209

Act 74, Session Laws 2011, added this section, establishing a misdemeanor offense for solicitation of prostitution near schools or public parks if, within seven hundred fifty feet of a school or a public park, a person offers or agrees to pay a fee to another person to engage in sexual conduct.
