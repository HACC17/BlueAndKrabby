Case Notes

Although it may have been error admitting into evidence, as expert opinion under HRE rule 702, officer's testimony concerning §712-1231(b), the social gambling defense, where defendant was not entitled to this defense in a prosecution for promoting gambling in the first degree under subsection (1)(c), error was harmless. 92 H. 98 (App.), 987 P.2d 996 (1999).
