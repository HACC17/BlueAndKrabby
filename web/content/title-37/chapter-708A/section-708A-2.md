COMMENTARY ON §708A-2

Act 22, Session Laws 1996, amended this section by replacing the word "state" with the word "jurisdiction" in the definitions of "specified unlawful activity" and "unlawful activity." The legislature intended to clarify that the Money Laundering Act applied not only to activities occurring within the State of Hawaii or the United States, but also to activities occurring outside the United States.
