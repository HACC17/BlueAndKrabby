COMMENTARY ON ยง706-600.5

Act 202, Session Laws 1987, clarified the time periods within this chapter by providing definitions for a "day," "month," and "year." This clarification should eliminate confusion by law enforcement personnel in regard to these time periods. House Standing Committee Report No. 556.

Act 4, Special Session Laws 2009, promoted the rehabilitation of convicted drug offenders through alternatives to incarceration by authorizing the placement of certain drug offenders in secure drug treatment facilities. Conference Committee Report No. 25\. Act 4 amended this section by adding the definition of "secure drug treatment facility."
