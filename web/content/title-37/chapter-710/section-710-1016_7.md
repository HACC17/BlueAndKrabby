**[ยง710-1016.7] Impersonating a law enforcement officer in the second degree.** (1) A person commits the offense of impersonating a law enforcement officer in the second degree if, with intent to deceive, the person pretends to be a law enforcement officer.

(2) Impersonating a law enforcement officer in the second degree is a misdemeanor. [L 1987, c 130, pt of ยง3]

Case Notes

Police officers did not violate a civil process server's Fourth Amendment rights, because the officers had probable cause to arrest the process server for impersonating a law enforcement officer; since no constitutional violation occurred, the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. 348 F. Supp. 2d 1165 (2004).
