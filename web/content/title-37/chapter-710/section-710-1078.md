(2) Whenever there is probable cause to believe that a person has violated subsection (1), the person shall be subject to arrest and removal from the presence of the legislature or either house or any committee of a house, by the sergeant-at-arms of the affected house or by any other law enforcement officer of the State, as directed by the sergeant-at-arms.

(3) Disrespect of a house of the legislature is a petty misdemeanor. [L 2012, c 204, ยง1]

COMMENTARY ON ยง710-1078

Act 204, Session Laws 2012, added this section to establish the petty misdemeanor offense of disrespect of a house of the legislature. While instances of contemptuous behavior are rare, the legislature believed that the law needed to be updated to address such possible behavior that can occur at any time.
