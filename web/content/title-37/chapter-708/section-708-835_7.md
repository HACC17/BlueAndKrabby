COMMENTARY ON §708-835.7

Act 197, Session Laws 2007, established theft of copper as a felony offense, to deter the theft of copper. The offense applies to copper weighing a pound or more. Act 197 has a sunset date of July 1, 2009\. Conference Committee Report No. 70.

Act 44, Session Laws 2009, made permanent the offense of theft of copper, as well as the documentation requirements for the sale of copper to scrap metal dealers and related penalties. The legislature found that the prohibitions, record-keeping requirements, and penalties in the current law had proven effective at deterring the theft of copper and should be made permanent. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1240.
