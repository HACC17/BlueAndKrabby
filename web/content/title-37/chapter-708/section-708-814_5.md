**[ยง708-814.5] Criminal trespass onto public parks and recreational grounds.** (1) A person commits the offense of criminal trespass onto public parks and recreational grounds if the person remains unlawfully in or upon a public park or recreational ground after a request to leave is made by any law enforcement officer, when the request is based upon violation by the person of any term of use specified on a sign or notice posted on the property, or based on violation of any term of use contained in, or the expiration of, any permit relating to the person's presence on the property.

(2) For the purposes of this section, unless the context requires otherwise:

"Law enforcement officer" has the same meaning as in section 710-1000.

"Public park or recreational ground" means any park, park roadway, playground, athletic field, beach, shore, beach or shore right-of-way, tennis court, golf course, swimming pool, or other recreational area or facility under control, maintenance, and management of the State or any of the counties.

(3) Criminal trespass onto public parks and recreational grounds is a petty misdemeanor. [L 2005, c 212, ยง2]
