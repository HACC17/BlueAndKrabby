**[ยง261-92] Questioning and detaining suspected persons aboard an aircraft.** A police officer may detain any person found upon an aircraft, under circumstances as reasonably justify a suspicion that the person boarded without permission, for the purpose of demanding, and may demand the name and address of the person and the nature of the person's business upon the aircraft. If the police officer has reason to believe that the person has no right to be upon the aircraft, the police officer may arrest the person without a warrant on the charge of violating section 261-91\.
