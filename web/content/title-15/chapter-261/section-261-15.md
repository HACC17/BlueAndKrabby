**§261-15 Federal airman and aircraft certificates.** (a) Operation without, unlawful. It shall be unlawful for any person to operate or cause or authorize to be operated any civil aircraft within the State unless the aircraft has an appropriate effective certificate, permit, or license issued by the United States, if the certificate, permit, or license is required by the United States. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in aeronautics as an airman in the State unless the person has an appropriate effective airman certificate, permit, rating, or license issued by the United States authorizing the person to engage in the particular class of aeronautics in which the person is engaged, if such certificate, permit, rating, or license is required by the United States.

(b) Exhibition of certificates. Where a certificate, permit, rating, or license is required for an airman by the United States, it shall be kept in the airman's personal possession when the airman is operating within the State and shall be presented for inspection upon the demand of any public officer, or any other officer of the State or of a municipality or member, official, or employee of the department of transportation authorized pursuant to section 261-17 to enforce the aeronautics laws, or any official, manager, or person in charge of any airport upon which the aircraft lands, or upon the reasonable request of any person.
