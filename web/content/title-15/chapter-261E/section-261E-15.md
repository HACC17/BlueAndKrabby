**[ยง261E-15] Issuance of securities; execution of leases.** A Hawaii air carrier, with the approval of the air carrier commission, may issue stocks and stock certificates, bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness, payable at periods of more than twelve months after the date thereof, and enter into long-term leases of more than five years and leverage leases, for the following purposes:

(1) For the acquisition or use of property;

(2) For the construction, completion, extension, or improvement of or addition to its facilities or service;

(3) For the discharge or lawful refunding of its obligations; and

(4) For the reimbursement of moneys actually expended from income or from any other moneys in its treasury not secured by or obtained from the issue of its stocks or stock certificates, or bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness, except maintenance of service, replacements, and substitutions not constituting capital expenditure in cases where the air carrier has kept its accounts for the expenditure in a manner as to enable the commission to ascertain the amount of moneys expended and the purposes for which the expenditures were made and the sources of the funds in its treasury applied to the expenditures.

A Hawaii air carrier may not issue securities or enter into long-term leases of more than three years and leverage leases, to acquire or use property or to construct, complete, extend, improve, or add to its facilities or service, if the commission determines that the proposed transaction will have a material adverse effect on the carrier's operations. No carrier shall repurchase or reissue its own common stock without the approval of the commission.

This section shall apply to a transaction involving a related company to the extent that the commission determines that the transaction may have a potential impact upon the relevant Hawaii air carrier or its operations. A related company shall notify the commission of any transaction at least sixty days prior to its consummation. [L Sp 2008, c 1, pt of ยง2]
