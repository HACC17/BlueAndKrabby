**[ยง269-16.8] Aggregators of telephone service requirements.** (a) For the purposes of this section:

"Aggregator" means every person or entity that is not a telecommunications carrier, who, in the ordinary course of its business, makes telephones available and aggregates the calls of the public or transient users of its business, including but not limited to a hotel, motel, hospital, or university, that provides operator-assisted services through access to an operator service provider.

"Operator service" means a service provided by a telecommunications company to assist a customer to complete a telephone call.

(b) The commission, by rule or order, shall adopt and enforce operating requirements for the provision of operator-assisted services by an aggregator. These requirements shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

(1) Posting and display of information in a prominent and conspicuous fashion on or near the telephone equipment owned or controlled by the aggregator which states the identity of the operator service provider, the operator service provider's complaint handling procedures, and means by which the customer may access the various operator service providers.

(2) Identification by name of the operator service provider prior to the call connection and, if not posted pursuant to subsection (b)(1), a disclosure of pertinent rates, terms, conditions, and means of access to various operator service providers and the local exchange carriers; provided that the operator service provider shall disclose this information at any time upon request by the customer.

(3) Allowing the customer access to any operator service provider operating in the relevant geographic area through the access method chosen by the provider or as deemed appropriate by the commission.

(4) Other requirements as deemed reasonable by the commission in the areas of public safety, quality of service, unjust or discriminatory pricing, or other matters in the public interest. [L 1989, c 241, ยง1]
