**[§269-16.22]  Power purchase agreements; cost recovery for electric utilities.** All power purchase costs, including costs related to capacity, operations and maintenance, and other costs that are incurred by an electric utility company, arising out of power purchase agreements that have been approved by the public utilities commission and are binding obligations on the electric utility company, shall be allowed to be recovered by the utility from the customer base of the electric utility company through one or more adjustable surcharges, which shall be established by the public utilities commission. The costs shall be allowed to be recovered if incurred as a result of such agreements unless, after review by the public utilities commission, any such costs are determined by the commission to have been incurred in bad faith, out of waste, out of an abuse of discretion, or in violation of law. For purposes of this section, an "electric utility company" means a public utility as defined under section 269-1, for the production, conveyance, transmission, delivery, or furnishing of electric power.
