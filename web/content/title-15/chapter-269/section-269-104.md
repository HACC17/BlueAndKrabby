**ยง269-104 Additional customer-generators.** Notwithstanding section 269-102, an electric utility is not obligated to provide net energy metering to additional customer-generators in its service area when the combined total peak generating capacity of all eligible customer-generators served by all the electric utilities in that service area furnishing net energy metering to eligible customer-generators equals .5 per cent of the system peak demand of those electric utilities; provided that the public utilities commission may increase, by rule or order, the allowable percentage of the electric utility's system peak demand produced from eligible customer-generators in the electric utility's service area, whereupon the electric utility will be obligated to provide net energy metering to additional eligible customer-generators in that service area up to the increased percentage amount.
