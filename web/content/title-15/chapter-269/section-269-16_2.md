**[ยง269-16.2]** **Approval of rules of a public utility.** Any rules, guidelines, or other standards of a public utility which interpret federal or state laws governing nonutility generators, or which make a nonutility generator monetarily responsible for the public utility's costs and profits of doing business as a public utility, shall be approved by the public utilities commission before adoption. As used in this section, a "nonutility generator" means a person that produces electric power but is not a public utility. [L 1994, c 176, ยง2]
