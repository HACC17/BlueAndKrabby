**[ยง269-27.3] Preferential renewable energy rates; agricultural activities.** It is the policy of the State to promote the long-term viability of agriculture by establishing mechanisms that provide for preferential rates for the purchase of renewable energy produced in conjunction with agricultural activities.

Upon receipt of a bona fide request for preferential rates for the purchase of renewable energy produced in conjunction with agricultural activities, and proof that the renewable energy is produced in conjunction with agricultural activities, a public utility shall forward the request for preferential rates to the public utilities commission for approval.
