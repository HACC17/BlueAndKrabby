**ยง269-16.95 Emergency telephone service; capital costs; ratemaking.** (a) A public utility providing local exchange telecommunications services may recover the capital cost and associated operating expenses of providing a statewide enhanced 911 emergency telephone service in the public switched telephone network, through:

(1) A telephone line surcharge; or

(2) Its rate case.

(b) Notwithstanding the commission's rules on ratemaking, the commission shall expedite and give highest priority to any necessary ratemaking procedures related to providing a statewide enhanced 911 emergency telephone service; provided that the commission may set forth conditions and requirements as the commission determines are in the public interest.
