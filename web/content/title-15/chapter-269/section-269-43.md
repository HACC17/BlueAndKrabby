**[ยง269-43]** **Carriers of last resort.** (a) The commission may define and designate local exchange service areas where the commission has determined that providing universal service funds to a single provider will be the most appropriate way to ensure service for these areas.

(b) The commission shall determine the level of service that is appropriate for each designated local exchange service area and shall invite telecommunications providers to bid for a level of service that is appropriate. The successful bidder shall be designated the carrier of last resort for the designated local exchange service area for a period of time and upon conditions set by the commission. In determining the successful bidder, the commission shall take into consideration the level of service to be provided, the investment commitment, and the length of the agreement, in addition to the other qualifications of the bidder.

(c) The universal service fund shall also provide service drops and basic service at discounted rates to public institutions, as stated in section 269-41.

(d) The commission shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to carry out the provisions of this section. [L 1995, c 225, pt of ยง2]
