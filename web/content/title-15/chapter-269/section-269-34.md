**[ยง269-34]** **Obligations of telecommunications carriers.** In accordance with conditions and guidelines established by the commission to facilitate the introduction of competition into the State's telecommunications marketplace, each telecommunications carrier, upon bona fide request, shall provide services or information services, on reasonable terms and conditions, to an entity seeking to provide intrastate telecommunications, including:

(1) Interconnection to the telecommunications carrier's telecommunications facilities at any technically feasible and economically reasonable point within the telecommunications carrier's network so that the networks are fully interoperable;

(2) The current interstate tariff used as the access rate until the commission can adopt a new intrastate local service interconnection tariff pursuant to section 269-37;

(3) Nondiscriminatory and equal access to any telecommunications carrier's telecommunications facilities, functions, and the information necessary to the transmission and routing of any telecommunications service and the interoperability of both carriers' networks;

(4) Nondiscriminatory access among all telecommunications carriers, where technically feasible and economically reasonable, and where safety or the provision of existing electrical service is not at risk, to the poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way owned or controlled by the telecommunications carrier, or the commission shall authorize access to electric utilities' poles as provided by the joint pole agreement, commission tariffs, rules, orders, or Federal Communications Commission rules and regulations;

(5) Nondiscriminatory access to the network functions of the telecommunications carrier's telecommunications network, that shall be offered on an unbundled, competitively neutral, and cost-based basis;

(6) Telecommunications services and network functions without unreasonable restrictions on the resale or sharing of those services and functions; and

(7) Nondiscriminatory access of customers to the telecommunications carrier of their choice without the need to dial additional digits or access codes, where technically feasible. The commission shall determine the equitable distribution of costs among the authorized telecommunications carriers that will use such access and shall establish rules to ensure such access.

Where possible, telecommunications carriers shall enter into negotiations to agree on the provision of services or information services without requiring intervention by the commission; provided that any such agreement shall be subject to review by the commission to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section.
