**[ยง269**-**27.5] Construction of high**-**voltage electric transmission lines; hearing.** Whenever a public utility plans to place, construct, erect, or otherwise build a new 46 kilovolt or greater high-voltage electric transmission system above the surface of the ground through any residential area, the public utilities commission shall conduct a public hearing prior to its issuance of approval thereof. Notice of the hearing shall be given in the manner provided in section 269-16 for notice of public hearings. [L 1976, c 11, ยง2]

Case Notes

Where general public had substantial opportunity to provide input, public utilities commission had established necessary procedures by which ratepayers could manifest their consent in order to persuade commission that cost of underground routing of transmission lines was acceptable. 81 H. 459, 918 P.2d 561.
