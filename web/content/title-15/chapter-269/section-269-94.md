**[ยง269-94 Waivers, extensions, and incentives.]** Any electric utility company not meeting the renewable portfolio standard shall report to the public utilities commission within ninety days following the goal dates established in section [269-92], and provide an explanation for not meeting the renewable portfolio standard. The public utilities commission shall have the option to either grant a waiver from the renewable portfolio standard or an extension for meeting the prescribed standard.

The public utilities commission may provide incentives to encourage electric utility companies to exceed their renewable portfolio standards or to meet their renewable portfolio standards ahead of time, or both. [L 2001, c 272, ยง5]
