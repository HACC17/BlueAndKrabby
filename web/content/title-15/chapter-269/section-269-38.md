**[ยง269**-**38]** **Regulatory flexibility for effectively competitive services.** The commission may allow telecommunications carriers to have pricing flexibility for services that the commission finds are effectively competitive; provided that the rates for:

(1) Basic telephone service and for services that are not effectively competitive are cost-based and remain just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory; and

(2) Universal service is preserved and advanced. [L 1995, c 225, pt of ยง2]
