**ยง263A-4 Consent of person incapable of refusal not withdrawn.** The consent of a person deemed to have given consent pursuant to section 263A-1 shall not be withdrawn by reason of the person's being dead, unconscious, or in any other state which renders the person incapable of consenting to examination, and the test may be given. In such event, a test of the person's blood shall be administered. [L 1991, c 274, pt of ยง1]
