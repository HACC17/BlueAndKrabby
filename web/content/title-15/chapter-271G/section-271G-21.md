**[ยง271G-21] Recovery of overcharges or undercharges.** (a) All actions by water carriers or common carriers by water for the recovery of their charges, or any part thereof, shall be begun within three years from the time the cause of action accrues, and not after.

(b) For recovery of overcharges, actions shall be begun within three years from the time the cause of action accrues, and not after, subject to subsection (c) of this section, except that if claim for the overcharge has been presented in writing to the carrier within the three-year period of limitation the period shall be extended to include six months from the time notice in writing is given by the carrier to the claimant of disallowance of the claim, or any part or parts thereof specified in the notice.

(c) If on or before the expiration of the three-year period of limitation in subsection (b) a common carrier by water begins action under subsection (a) for recovery of charges in respect of the same transportation service, or, without beginning action, collects charges in respect of that service, the period shall be extended to include ninety days from the time the action is begun or the charges are collected by the carrier.

(d) The cause of action in respect of a shipment of property shall, for the purpose of this section, be deemed to accrue upon delivery or tender of delivery thereof by the carrier, and not after.
