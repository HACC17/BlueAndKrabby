**[ยง279G-3] Findings.** The legislature finds:

(1) Public and private expenditures will be reduced by increases in ridesharing, particularly in maintenance and construction costs for highways.

(2) Increased energy consumption, air pollution, traffic congestion, and motor vehicle parking constitute a serious problem in the State, particularly in urban areas, and ridesharing is a cost-effective alternative approach for solving these problems.

(3) The increased use of ridesharing will contribute to conservation of fuel, improvement of air quality, and more effective use of existing streets, highways, and parking facilities.

(4) Ridesharing constitutes one of the most cost-effective and energy-efficient means of transportation.

(5) Many employees work in and commute to the downtown area of Honolulu where the problems associated with traffic congestion, parking, energy consumption, and air pollution are greatest.

(6) It is in the public interest and a public purpose for private industry, cities, counties, and the State to encourage people to use alternatives to single occupant motor vehicles, such as ridesharing. [L 1986, c 90, ยง1]
