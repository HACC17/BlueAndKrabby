**ยง279G-2 Liability for promoters of ridesharing arrangements.** (a) For purposes of this section the term "entity" refers to the State, the counties, schools, community organizations, private nonprofit organizations, rideshare coordinators, and employers who encourage participation in ridesharing arrangements.

(b) An entity shall not be liable for injuries to passengers and other persons because the entity provides information, incentives, or otherwise encourages the public, students, or employees to participate in ridesharing arrangements; provided that this section shall not apply if the motor vehicle used in the ridesharing arrangement is owned, leased, or contracted for by the entity.
