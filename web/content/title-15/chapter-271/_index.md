Case Notes

Public utilities commission correctly determined that it could not assume jurisdiction over federal military camp and dismissed complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as Article VI of the U.S. Constitution preempted any state regulation over the military camp; it was not shown that camp was not an instrumentality of the United States and therefore not entitled to invoke immunity or that the camp was an instrumentality of the United States, but there was a clear and unambiguous congressional authorization waiving camp's immunity from direct state regulation. 112 H. 150, 145 P.3d 693.
