**[ยง269E-5] One call center established.** (a) By January 1, 2006, the commission shall establish and begin administration of a one call center that provides advance warning to excavators in this State of the location of subsurface installations in the area of an excavation for the purpose of protecting those installations from damage. In establishing the center, the commission shall consider the availability of experienced center providers. The commission shall award administration of the center to the provider the commission determines to be best qualified to provide center services. In reviewing a provider's qualifications, the commission shall consider cost, quality of service, experience, and other factors the commission deems appropriate.

(b) Pursuant to rules adopted by the commission, all operators shall furnish to the center information relating to subsurface installations that the center may use to identify operators known to have subsurface installations in the area of a proposed excavation; provided that operators shall not be required to furnish to the center information relating to subsurface installations that are deemed confidential or proprietary.
