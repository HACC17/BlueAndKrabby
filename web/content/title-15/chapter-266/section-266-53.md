**ยง266**-**53 Findings and determination for special facility leases.** The department shall not enter into any special facility lease unless the department shall first find and determine that:

(1) The special facility which is to be the subject of such special facility lease will not be used to provide services, commodities, supplies, or facilities which are then adequately being made available through the harbors system of the State;

(2) The use or occupancy of the special facility under such special facility lease would not result in the reduction of the revenues derived from the harbors system to an amount below the amount required to be derived therefrom by section 39-61; and

(3) The entering into of such special facility lease would not be in violation of or result in a breach of any covenant contained in any resolution or certificate authorizing any bonds of the State and the department then outstanding. [L 1980, c 126, pt of ยง2; am L 1993, c 2, ยง2 and c 212, ยง2]
