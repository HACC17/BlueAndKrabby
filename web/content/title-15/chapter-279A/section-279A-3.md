**[ยง279A-3 Financial plan.]** The statewide transportation plan shall include a financial plan for the projected elements of the statewide transportation system, including both those sub-systems which are within the counties' authorities and responsibilities and the sub-systems which are within the State's authorities and responsibilities. In respect to sub-systems planned and to be implemented by the counties, the financial plan will identify those which may involve state financial assistance and will estimate the projected amounts of such assistance.

The financial plan shall consider various sources of revenue without regard to any constraints imposed by law on expenditures from such sources necessary to assure adequate financing of the sub-systems and, if necessary, recommend appropriate legislation to the legislature to secure such financing. [L 1975, c 179, ยง3]
