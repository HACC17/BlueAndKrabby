**ยง264-15 Highway advance acquisition; source of funds.** The director may, with the approval of the governor, expend moneys appropriated by the legislature as may be necessary for the acquisition of real property when the director determines:

(1) The acquisition of the real property is necessary for a state highway project authorized by the legislature;

(2) Funds previously authorized by the legislature are inadequate; and

(3) That any delay in the acquisition of such property would unnecessarily increase the cost of the highway project;

provided that the selected corridor and alignment of the project shall have been approved by the governor.

All moneys received from the rental, sale, or lease of any property acquired under this section shall be paid into the state general fund; provided that whenever federal funds are involved in the acquisition of the property, any money received from the sale, lease, or rental of such property shall be expended toward the project for which the property was acquired.
