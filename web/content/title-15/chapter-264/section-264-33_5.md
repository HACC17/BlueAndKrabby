(b) The director of transportation may make exceptions to subsection (a) if:

(1) The director determines that exceptions are appropriate due to either:

(A) Any of the following criteria: environmental, safety, research, technology, corridor alignment, or management concern; or

(B) The following criteria collectively: state funding impacts, economic feasibility, and federal funding concerns; or

(2) The projects do not lend themselves to undergrounding, such as: resurfacing, traffic signal installation, drainage installation, bikeway markings, guardrail installation, traffic markings, and enhancement improvements. [L 1996, c 84, ยง2]
