**ยง264-67 Local service roads.** In connection with the development of any controlled-access facility, the director of transportation may plan, designate, establish, use, regulate, alter, realign, widen, improve, maintain, and vacate local service roads and streets or designate as local service roads and streets any existing public highway, and exercise jurisdiction over service roads and streets in the same manner as is authorized over controlled-access facilities under this part, if, in the director's opinion, the local service roads or streets are necessary or desirable. The local service roads or streets shall be of appropriate design, and shall be separated from the controlled-access facility proper by means of all devices designated as necessary or desirable by the director.
