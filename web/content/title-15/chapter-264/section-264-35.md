(b) The director of transportation, in estimating the cost of any project under section 106, Title 23, United States Code, for right-of-way acquisition or actual construction, shall include as a part of the cost of construction on any of the federal-aid highway systems, relocation payments to be made initially by the director, from state highway funds, to eligible persons for their reasonable and necessary moving expenses caused by their displacement from real property acquired for such project.

(c) Payments under this section shall not exceed $200 in the case of an individual or family, or $3,000 in the case of a business concern (including the operation of a farm) or nonprofit organization. In the case of a business (including the operation of a farm) and in the case of a nonprofit organization, the allowable expenses for transportation under this subsection shall not exceed the cost of moving fifty miles from the point from which the business or organization is being displaced.
