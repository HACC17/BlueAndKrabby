**ยง264-82 Purposes.** For the purpose of promoting the public safety, health, welfare, convenience, and enjoyment of public travel, to protect the public investment in public highways, and to preserve and enhance the scenic beauty of lands bordering public highways, it is declared to be in the public interest to regulate and restrict the establishment, operation, and maintenance of junkyards in areas adjacent to federal-aid or state highways within the State. The legislature finds, determines, and declares that junkyards which do not conform to the requirements of this part are public nuisances.
