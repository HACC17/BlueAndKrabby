**§182-11 Assignment.** Any mining lease may be assigned in whole or in part, subject to the approval of the board, to an assignee who shall have the same qualifications as any bidder for a mining lease. The assignee shall be bound by the terms of the lease to the extent as if the assignee were the original lessee. The approval of the assignment by the board shall release the assignor from any liabilities or duties under the mining lease as to the portion thereof assigned except for any liability or duty which arose prior to the approval of the assignment by the board and which remains unsatisfied or unperformed.
