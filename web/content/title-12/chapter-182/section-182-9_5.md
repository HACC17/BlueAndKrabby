**[ยง182-9.5] Unitization.** Upon motion by the board or petition filed by any mining lessee, the board, in its discretion, may order such lessees or owners of mineral rights on adjoining properties to collectively adopt, and operate under, a cooperative or unit plan of development, if the board finds that such a plan will prevent the waste of any mineral, increase the ultimate recovery, avoid the drilling, digging, or excavating of any unnecessary well, or for such other reason that would encourage and promote the development of any mineral resource. [L 1978, c 135, ยง8]
