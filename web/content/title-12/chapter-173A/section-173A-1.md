**[ยง173A-1] Purpose.** The State has provided for the regulation of land use and development throughout the State under the provisions of the land use law, and has provided through that law for the controlled regulation of land use and development of lands which have natural, environmental, recreational, scenic or historic value. However, these lands, though protected by the land use law, may in many instances require placement under public ownership and management in order that they can be made accessible to all of the people of the State. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the acquisition and management of such lands in those instances in which such acquisition and management are considered necessary by the State.
