Case Notes

Where the subject matter covered by Revised Ordinances of Honolulu §7-7.2 was the protection of the public against harm caused by dangerous dogs anywhere within the City's territorial limits by imposing criminal sanctions on dog owners who negligently fail to control their dangerous dogs, the ordinance was not aimed at regulating activities or managing resources within ocean waters; thus, the ordinance did not cover the same subject matter embraced by the department's authority to manage and control ocean waters pursuant to this section and did not conflict with state law. 120 H. 486 (App.), 210 P.3d 9.
