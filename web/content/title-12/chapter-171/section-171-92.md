**ยง171-92 Existing public leases.** Where a person has an unexpired lease, including a residential lease, of public land damaged by a natural disaster and rebuilding on such land is not prohibited, the board of land and natural resources may negotiate an extension of the lease to make it economically feasible to rebuild, or may, by mutual agreement with the lessee and the holder of record having security interest, cancel the unexpired term of the lease and negotiate a new lease with the person.
