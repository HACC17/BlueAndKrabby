**[ยง171-151] Definitions.** For the purposes of this part:

"Beach lands" means all lands in the shoreline area including sand, rocky, or cobble beaches, dune systems, landward and seaward sand reserves, and all such lands subject to the natural processes of erosion and accretion. The term includes easements and rights in such land and any improvements on land.

"Beach restoration" means the placement of sand, with or without stabilizing structures, on an eroded beach from an outside source such as offshore sand deposits, streams, channels or harbor mouths, or an upland sand quarry.

"Coastal lands" means all land within the state coastal zone management area; provided that any leasing or development of public lands shall be limited to all fast lands up to one mile mauka of the shoreline and all submerged lands. [L 1999, c 84, pt of ยง2]
