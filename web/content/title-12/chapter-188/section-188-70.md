Case Notes

As sentencing court limited to alternatives expressly enumerated in this section and probation not an enumerated alternative, offense of fishing with gill nets under §188-30.2 nonprobationable; thus, under §853-4(5), deferred acceptance of no contest plea not allowed for that offense. 87 H. 102, 952 P.2d 390.
