**§188-36 Hawaii marine laboratory refuge.** It is unlawful for any person within the Hawaii marine laboratory refuge to take any aquatic life. Nothing in this section shall apply to any officer, faculty member, employee, or student of the University of Hawaii or licensee of the board of regents of the University of Hawaii, while employed in catching or taking aquatic life for scientific purposes.

The Hawaii marine laboratory refuge consists of the reefs and bay waters surrounding the island of Moku-o-loe located in Kaneohe Bay, island of Oahu, from the high water mark on the island extending outward to "twenty-five feet beyond the outer edges of the reefs".

All laws enacted for the protection of aquatic life or wildlife shall likewise apply to the Hawaii marine laboratory refuge, except that no person or persons, other than those designated by this section, shall be authorized to catch or take aquatic life in the refuge.

The Hawaii marine laboratory refuge shall continue only as long as the regents of the University of Hawaii maintain the Hawaii marine laboratory on the island of Moku-o-loe, island of Oahu.
