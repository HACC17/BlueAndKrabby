Case Notes

Sections 183D-22 and 183D-10.5 provided the authority for the department of land and natural resources to require payment of a fee for a hunting-related article such as a stamp; however, since game bird hunting was an activity permitted under this chapter, the department was required under ยง183D-3 to adopt a rule pursuant to ยง91-3 when setting the stamp fees for hunting. 117 H. 16 (App.), 175 P.3d 126.
