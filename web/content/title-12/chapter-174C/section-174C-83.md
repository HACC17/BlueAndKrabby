**[ยง174C-83] Registration of all existing wells.** Any person owning or operating any well shall register the well with the commission. Registration shall be on the forms provided by the commission. The registration report shall include such information as prescribed by the commission, including the water use permit number; the location of the well; the diameter of the well; the maximum capacity of the well; the name of the well driller who constructed the well; and the name of the pump installation contractor who installed the pump and pumping equipment.

The commission may deny the issuance of a water use permit under part IV, until such time as the applicant registers all wells which the applicant owns or operates. [L 1987, c 45, pt of ยง2]
