**[ยง174C-47] Modifying and rescinding designated areas.** The modification of the boundaries or the rescinding of existing water management areas by the commission may be initiated by the chairperson or by a petition to the commission by any person with proper standing. The procedure for modifying the boundaries of an existing water management area or for rescinding an existing water management area shall be substantially similar to that for the designation of a water management area.
