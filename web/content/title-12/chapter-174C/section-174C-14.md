**[ยง174C-14] Acquisition of real property.** (a) The legislature declares it to be necessary for the public health and welfare that water and water related resources be conserved and protected. The acquisition of real property for this objective shall constitute a public purpose for which public funds may be expended.

(b) The commission may acquire real property and easements by purchase, gift, devise, lease, eminent domain, or otherwise for flood control, water management, or water and water-related resource conservation.

(c) Land, water areas, and related resources which may be acquired for this purpose include, but are not limited to, streams and other watercourses, parks and recreation areas, beaches, submerged lands, and other open areas, as well as necessary access sites and rights-of-way.

(d) This section does not limit the exercise of similar powers delegated by statute to any state or local government agency. This section is not intended to limit, in any way, the powers of the commission in regards to the acquisition of real property under any other statute. [L 1987, c 45, pt of ยง2]
