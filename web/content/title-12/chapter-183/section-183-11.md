On lands under lease the reserve shall not take effect until the expiration of the existing lease, or in any way affect the rights acquired under the lease. Any land or lands while so set apart shall not be leased or sold by the government or used in any way for any purposes inconsistent with this chapter. The governor may from time to time, with the approval of the department, after a hearing or hearings as hereinafter provided, revoke, modify, or suspend any and all [of] the orders and proclamations or any part thereof, which set apart the lands.
