Case Notes

The public trust duties imposed on the State under article XI, ยง1 of the Hawaii constitution also applied to the county, as a political subdivision of the State; article XI, ยง1 mandates that the county has an obligation to conserve and protect the State's natural resources; the county's power under the general laws with respect to its public trust duty to protect the natural resources of the State can be found in this chapter; thus, the county had a duty to protect the waters located adjacent to defendant's property. 111 H. 205, 140 P.3d 985.
