**§174-13 Petition of land occupiers for formation of water project.** Land occupiers, including the Hawaiian homes commission, comprising at least sixty per cent of the acreage of lands lying within an area proposed to be organized into a water project may file a petition with the board of land and natural resources requesting that the project be organized. Where any of the lands of the petitioners in the proposed area are leased lands, it shall be necessary for the lessor and lessee to join in the petition. The petition shall contain a general description and the acreage of the area proposed to be organized into a water project and shall state the acreage owned or leased by each of the petitioners within that area. Before the board shall commence any water project involving homesteaded lands of the Hawaiian homes commission, it shall require the commission to assure the payment of any acreage assessment thereon, in pursuance of section 208(5) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920\.
