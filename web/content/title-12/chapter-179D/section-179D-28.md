**[§179D-28] Dams and reservoirs under construction, enlargement, repair, alteration, or removal before July 6, 2007.** (a) Any dam or reservoir that falls within the definitions of a dam or reservoir in this chapter and which the board finds was under construction, enlargement, repair, alteration, or removal, and based on its findings not more than ninety per cent constructed, enlarged, repaired, altered, or removed on July 6, 2007, except as provided in subsection (b), shall be subject to the same provisions in this section as a dam or reservoir commenced after that date. Every owner of a dam or reservoir subject to this section shall file an application with the board for the board's written application approval of the plans and specifications for the dam or reservoir.

(b) Construction, enlargement, repair, alteration, or removal work on the dam or reservoir may proceed; provided an application for approval of the plans and specifications is filed; until:

(1) An application approval is received by the owner approving the dam or reservoir; or

(2) An order is received by the owner specifying how the construction, enlargement, repair, alteration, or removal must be performed to render the dam or reservoir safe.

After receipt of an application approval or order specifying how construction, enlargement, repair, alteration, or removal of the dam or reservoir must be performed, work thereafter must be in accordance with the application approval or order. [L 2007, c 262, pt of §1]
