**§196-22 State energy projects.** State energy projects may be implemented under this chapter with the approval of the comptroller and the director of finance or their designees. In addition, this section shall be construed to provide the greatest possible flexibility to agencies in structuring agreements so that economic benefits and existing energy incentives may be used and maximized, and financing and other costs to agencies may be minimized. The specific terms of energy performance contracting under section 36-41 may be altered if deemed advantageous to the agency and approved by the director of finance and the comptroller.
