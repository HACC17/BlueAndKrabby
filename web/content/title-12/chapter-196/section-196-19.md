**[ยง196-19] Life-cycle cost analysis.** Agencies shall use life-cycle cost analysis in making decisions about their investments in products, services, construction, and other projects to lower the State's costs and to reduce energy and water consumption. Where appropriate, agencies shall consider the life-cycle costs of combinations of projects, particularly to encourage bundling of energy efficiency projects with renewable energy projects.

Agencies shall retire inefficient equipment on an accelerated basis where replacement results in lower life-cycle costs. Agencies that minimize life-cycle costs with efficiency measures shall be recognized in their scorecard evaluations established under section 196-17(a). [L 2002, c 77, pt of ยง9]

Note

Section 196-17(a) referred to in text is repealed.
