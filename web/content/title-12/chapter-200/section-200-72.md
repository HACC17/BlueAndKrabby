**[ยง200-72] Defacing, etc., vessel hull identification numbers.** No person shall wilfully deface, destroy, remove, or alter the vessel hull identification number which is carved, burned, stamped, embossed, or otherwise permanently affixed to the hull of a vessel by the manufacturer, or by the owner in the case of restoration, for the purpose of identifying the hull. This section does not prohibit the restoration by an owner of an original number when the restoration is authorized by the department, nor prevent any manufacturer from placing in the ordinary course of business, numbers or marks upon new hulls.
