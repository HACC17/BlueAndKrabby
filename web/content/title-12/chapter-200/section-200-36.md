**[ยง200-36] Preemption of local law and special rules.** If any ordinance or rule of any county of the State conflicts or is inconsistent with this part or with the rules adopted pursuant thereto, the ordinance or rule shall be void.

Any county of the State, at any time, may make formal request to the chairperson for the department to adopt special rules with reference to the operation and use of vessels on any waters within its jurisdiction. The request shall set forth the reasons which make these special rules necessary or appropriate.

The department may make special rules with reference to the operation and use of vessels on any waters of the State as may be reasonably necessary to implement the declared policy of section 200-21\. [L 1991, c 272, pt of ยง2]
