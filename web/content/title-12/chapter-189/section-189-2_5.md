(b) It is unlawful to engage in longline fishing or to sell or offer for sale, any marine life taken with longline fishing gear within the boundaries of the State's territorial sea.

(c) Pursuant to and in cooperation with the joint federal-state Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (WPRFMC also known as WESPAC), of which Hawaii is a member, the State adopts and incorporates by reference the rules adopted by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for the management and regulation of longline fishing activities.

(1) Accordingly, it is unlawful for any person to possess, land, sell, or offer for sale any marine life taken by longline fishing gear which is prohibited by or in violation of rules properly adopted by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which by incorporation and acceptance are also the law of Hawaii.

(1) The State's marine waters as defined in section 189-1.5; and

(2) Those areas under the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council's jurisdiction where properly adopted rules have been established to govern, regulate, and manage longline fishing activities; provided that the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council shall have accepted and entered into a mutual working agreement with the State to carry out these rules, including the joint deputizing of law enforcement officials.

(e) The commercial marine license of any person convicted of violating this section shall be revoked and penalties pursuant to section 199-7, including equipment and gear seizure and forfeiture, shall be assessed.
