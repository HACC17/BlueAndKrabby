**ยง388-5 Unconditional payment of wages conceded to be due.** (a) In case of a dispute as to the amount of wages, the employer shall pay, without condition and within the time set by this chapter, all wages, or parts thereof, conceded by the employer to be due, leaving to the employee all remedies the employee might otherwise be entitled to, including those provided under this chapter, as to any balance claimed.

(b) The acceptance by an employee of a payment under this section shall not constitute a release or accord and satisfaction with respect to the disputed amount and any release required by an employer as a condition to payment shall be in violation of this chapter and shall be null and void.
