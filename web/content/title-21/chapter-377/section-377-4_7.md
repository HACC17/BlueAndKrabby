**[ยง****377-4.7]** **Facilitating initial collective bargaining agreements.** (a) No later than ten days after receiving a written request for collective bargaining from an individual or labor organization that has been newly organized or certified as a representative, the parties shall meet and commence to bargain collectively and shall make every reasonable effort to conclude and sign a collective bargaining agreement.

(b) If, after the expiration of the ninety-day period beginning on the date on which bargaining commenced, or such additional period as the parties may agree upon, the parties have failed to reach an agreement, either party may notify the board of the existence of a dispute and request conciliation under section 377-3.

(c) If, after the expiration of the twenty-day period beginning on the date on which the request for conciliation is made under subsection (b), or such additional period as the parties may agree upon, the conciliator is not able to bring the parties to agreement by conciliation, the board shall refer the dispute to an arbitration panel established in accordance with section 89-11(e)(2)(A) and rules as may be prescribed by the board. The arbitration panel shall render a decision settling the dispute, and the decision shall be binding upon the parties for a period of two years, unless amended during that period by written consent of the parties.
