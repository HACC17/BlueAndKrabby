**ยง373-14.3 Hearings.** In all proceedings, the director or hearings officer duly appointed by the director shall have the same powers respecting administering oaths, compelling the attendance of witnesses, producing documentary evidence, and examining witnesses as are possessed by circuit courts. In case of disobedience by any person of any order or subpoena issued by the director or hearings officer, or the refusal of any witness to testify to any matter regarding which the witness may be questioned lawfully, any circuit judge, on application by the director or hearings officer, shall compel obedience as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued by a circuit court, or a refusal to testify therein. [L 1983, c 84, pt of ยง1(1); am L 1992, c 202, ยง4]
