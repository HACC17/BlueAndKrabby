**[ยง393-44] Investment of moneys.** With the approval of the department the director of finance may, from time to time, invest such moneys in the premium supplementation fund as are in excess of the amount deemed necessary for the payment of benefits for a reasonable future period. Such moneys may be invested in bonds of any political or municipal corporation or subdivision of the State, or any of the outstanding bonds of the State, or invested in bonds or interest-bearing notes or obligations of the State (including state director of finance's warrant notes issued pursuant to chapter 40), or of the United States, or those for which the faith and credit of the United States are pledged for the payment of principal and interest, or in federal land bank bonds or joint stock farm loan bonds. The investments shall at all times be so made that all the assets of the fund shall always be readily convertible into cash when needed for the payment of benefits. The director of finance shall dispose of securities or other properties belonging to the fund only under the direction of the director of labor and industrial relations. [L 1974, c 210, pt of ยง1]
