**[§393-15] Continuation of coverage in case of inability to earn wages.** If an employee is hospitalized or otherwise prevented by sickness from working, the employer shall enable the employee to continue the employee's coverage by contributing to the premium the amounts paid by the employer toward such premium prior to the employee's sickness for the period that such employee is hospitalized or prevented by sickness from working. This obligation shall not exceed a period of three months following the month during which the employee became hospitalized or disabled from working, or the period for which the employer has undertaken the payment of the employee's regular wages in such case, whichever is longer. [L 1974, c 210, pt of §1; gen ch 1985]
