**ยง393-48 Prepaid health care benefits to be paid from the premium supplementation fund; recovery of benefits.** Prepaid health care benefits shall be paid from the premium supplementation fund to an employee who is entitled to receive prepaid health care benefits but cannot receive such benefits because of bankruptcy of the employee's employer or because the employee's employer is not in compliance with this chapter. Benefits paid from the premium supplementation fund to such employee may be recovered from the employee's bankrupt or noncomplying employer. The director shall institute administrative and legal actions as provided in section 393-33 to effect recovery of such benefits. [L 1978, c 3, ยง1; gen ch 1985]
