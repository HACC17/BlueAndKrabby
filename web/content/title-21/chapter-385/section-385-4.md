**§385-4 Weekly benefit amount.** A claimant's weekly benefit amount under this chapter shall be the same as the claimant's weekly normal benefit amount payable during the claimant's current benefit year if the claimant has an unexpired benefit year, or the claimant's most recent benefit year less that part of wages (if any) payable to the claimant with respect to such week which is in excess of $2; provided that if the claimant was self-employed during the week in which the disaster identified by the governor in the proclamation provided for in section 385-1 occurred, or the claimant was employed during such week but the claimant's total earned wages are insufficient to entitle the claimant to normal benefits, then the claimant's weekly benefit amount shall be the average weekly benefit payable at that time less that part of wages (if any) payable to the claimant with respect to such week which is in excess of $2\.
