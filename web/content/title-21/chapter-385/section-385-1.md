**§385-1 Additional unemployment compensation benefits; payable when.** The additional unemployment benefits provided for in this chapter shall be authorized when a disaster, either natural or manmade, has struck the State, or any county thereof causing damage to a substantial number of persons and families so as to require assistance from the State, and an unemployment problem has been created thereby.

Upon the occurrence of the disaster, the governor may provide additional unemployment benefits in the appropriate county or counties as provided for in this chapter. The additional benefits shall be operative upon the issuance by the governor of a proclamation specifically invoking this chapter and identifying the county or counties which have been affected and in which provision for additional unemployment benefits shall be made operative. [L 1961, c 157, pt of §1; Supp, §93B-2; [HRS §385-1](/title-21/chapter-385/section-385-1/); am L 1972, c 47, §1]
