A. Hawaii Guard

**§386-161 Who entitled to compensation.** If a member of the Hawaii national guard or Hawaii state defense force suffers a personal injury arising out of and in the performance of the member's duty therein, compensation shall be paid to the member or the member's dependents by the State for such injury in the manner and in the amounts provided for in this chapter; provided that if in any case arising after May 10, 1951, any such member or the member's dependents receive compensation from the federal government by reason of such injury, the amount of the compensation shall be deducted from the amount which may thereafter become due from the State.
