**[ยง386-87.1] Standing to intervene in appeals.** In any proceeding before the appellate board under section 386-87, a prepaid health care plan contractor, as defined in section 393-3, may participate as a party in interest for the sole purpose of asserting its subrogation rights or other reimbursement right against any employer or insurance carrier for medical benefits which were previously paid by the contractor provided however any reimbursement shall be in accordance with the appropriate health care provider fee schedule. A prepaid health care plan contractor shall not have a right to intervene or participate on any other contested issue including the issue of compensability or entitlement to benefits before the appellate board.
