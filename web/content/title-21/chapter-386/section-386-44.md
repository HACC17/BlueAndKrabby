**ยง386-44 Effect of erroneous payment; insanity of beneficiary.** If an employer in good faith pays weekly benefits to a dependent who is inferior in right to another dependent or with whom another dependent is entitled to share, the payment shall discharge the employer, unless and until such other dependent notifies the employer of such other dependent's claim. In case the employer is in doubt as to the respective rights of rival claimants, the employer may institute proceedings before the director of labor and industrial relations for determination of the proper beneficiary.

Benefits to a person who is insane shall be paid to the person's guardian. [L 1963, c 116, pt of ยง1; Supp, ยง97-43; [HRS ยง386-44](/title-21/chapter-386/section-386-44/); gen ch 1985]
