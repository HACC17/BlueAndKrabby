**ยง386A-3 Fund's purpose.** The fund's purpose is to sell workers' compensation insurance at the lowest actuarially responsible price as determined by the fund's board. The fund shall commence operation upon appointment and qualification of the initial five members of the fund's board, but the workers' compensation insurance sold initially by the fund shall provide insurance coverage for work injuries occurring from a date to be established by the board and not more than one year from the date of the appointment and qualification.

The fund may serve as a model for the workers' compensation insurance industry to determine minimum insurance premium rates. It shall be competitive with other private workers' compensation insurance carriers. [L 1985, c 296, pt of ยง11; am L 1989, c 277, ยง4]
