Case Notes

Language of chapter was of considerable breadth as to afford the plaintiff a claim for back wages. 71 H. 458, 795 P.2d 276 (1990).

Appellants were not deprived of any identifiable property interest by the registration of an apprenticeship program, under this chapter, initiated by the union, so as to invoke due process protections by way of a contested case hearing. 104 H. 275, 88 P.3d 647 (2004).
