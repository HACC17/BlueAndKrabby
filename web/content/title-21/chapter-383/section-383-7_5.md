**[****ยง383-7.5] Part-time work; benefits available.** Notwithstanding any law to the contrary under this chapter, an individual shall not be denied regular unemployment benefits relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work, solely because the individual is seeking only part-time work; provided that this section shall not apply if a majority of the weeks of work in the individual's base period does not include part-time work.
