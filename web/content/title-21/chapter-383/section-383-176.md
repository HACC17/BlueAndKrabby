**[ยง383-176] Limitation of extended benefits by trade readjustment allowance.** Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, if the benefit year of any individual ends within an extended benefit period, the remaining balance of extended benefits that such individual, but for this section, would be entitled to receive in that extended benefit period, with respect to weeks of unemployment beginning after the end of the benefit year, shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the product of the number of weeks for which the individual received any amount as trade readjustment allowance within that benefit year, multiplied by the individual's weekly benefit amount for extended benefits. [L 1982, c 58, ยง5]
