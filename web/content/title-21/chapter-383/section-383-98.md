Any substitute referee, while so serving, shall have all the powers and duties of a referee and shall receive compensation for the substitute referee's services at the daily rate provided at step G of the salary range of full-time referees under the classified service for each day's actual attendance upon the substitute referee's duties and shall also be paid such reasonable traveling and other expenses as may be incurred in the discharge of the substitute referee's duties, the compensation and expenses to be paid out of the employment security administration fund.
