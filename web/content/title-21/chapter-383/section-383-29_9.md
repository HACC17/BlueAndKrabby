**[****§383-29.9] Partial unemployment; reporting requirements.** (a) An employer to whom a claimant for partial unemployment is still attached shall submit verification of earnings and satisfy all low earnings reporting requirements in subsection (b) and rules of the department for each week that the claimant certifies for partial unemployment benefits.

(b) Low earnings reports shall be submitted as follows:

(1) Whenever, during any weekly pay period in an individual's benefit year, an individual has worked less than full-time hours for the regular employer to which the individual is attached, and the individual's earnings are less than the individual's current weekly benefit amount, the individual's employer, upon request by the department shall:

(A) Enter the individual's name, social security account number, gross earnings, week-ending date, and the reasons for the individual's reduced workweek on a form provided or approved by the department and return the form to the unemployment insurance office as instructed within five working days after the notice of an individual's benefit amount has been mailed to the employer as to all prior weeks for which benefits are claimed. Thereafter, during the benefit year, the employer shall report within five working days after the end of each week or weekly pay period for which the low earnings reports are required; or

(B) Furnish the individual personally with the information on a form provided or approved by the department and the individual shall be responsible to submit the report to the unemployment insurance office within five working days after the end of each week or weekly pay period or as instructed by the department.

(2) If the employer or individual fails to submit the low earnings report as prescribed in paragraph (1)(A) or (B) within the time specified by the department, the department shall determine the individual's eligibility for any week's benefits claimed based on the individual's certification of employment and earnings.
