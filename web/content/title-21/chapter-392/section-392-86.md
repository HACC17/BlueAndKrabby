B. Determinations Relating to

Wage Withholding

**[ยง392-86] Disputes between employers and employees relating to withholding of wages.** In the case that there is a dispute between the employee and the employer relating to the withholding of wages as contributions for temporary disability benefits, either party may file with the director a petition for determination of the amount to be withheld.

The matter shall be determined by an officer of the department. If either party is dissatisfied with the determination, the party may petition for redetermination and thereupon the petition shall be transferred to the referee. [L 1969, c 148, pt of ยง1; gen ch 1985]
