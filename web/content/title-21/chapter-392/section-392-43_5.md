**ยง392-43.5 Payments of premium for ineligible employees not permitted.** An insurer providing benefits for the employees of an employer or an association of employers, shall not require the payment of premiums from such employer or association of employers for employees who do not meet the eligibility requirements of section 392-25\. However, in the case of employees who concurrently work for more than one employer and are deemed eligible to receive benefits by combining the wages earned and hours worked of the two or more employments, the insurer shall require the payment of premiums in accordance with section 392-43\. The employers or association of employers shall ensure that eligible employees with concurrent employments are provided the required coverage. [L 1977, c 88, ยง1]
