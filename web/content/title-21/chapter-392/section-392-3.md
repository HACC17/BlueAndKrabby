**§392-3 Definitions generally.** As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

"Benefit year" with respect to any individual means the one-year period beginning with the first day of the first week of disability with respect to which the individual first files a valid claim for temporary disability benefits. A subsequent benefit year is the one-year period following a preceding benefit year, beginning either with the first:

(1) Day of the first week of disability with respect to which the individual files a subsequent claim for temporary disability benefits; or

(2) Workday following the expiration of the preceding benefit year if a disability for which temporary disability benefits are payable during the last week of the preceding benefit year continues and the individual is eligible for further benefit payments.

"Contributions" means the amounts of money authorized by this chapter to be withheld from employees' wages for the payment of temporary disability benefits.

"Department" means the department of labor and industrial relations.

"Director" means the director of labor and industrial relations.

"Disability" means total inability of an employee to perform the duties of the employee's employment caused by sickness, pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, organ donation, or accident other than a work injury as defined in section 386-3.

"Employer" means any individual or type of organization, including the State, any of its political subdivisions, any instrumentality of the State or its political subdivisions, any partnership, association, trust, estate, joint stock company, insurance company, or corporation, whether domestic or foreign, or receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or the legal representative of a deceased person, who has one or more individuals in employment during any day or portion of a day.

"Employment" and "employed" means service, including service in interstate commerce, performed for wages under any contract of hire, written or oral, express or implied, with an employer, except as otherwise provided in sections 392-4 and 392-5.

"Recipient of social service payments" includes:

(1) A person who is an eligible recipient of social services such as attendant care and day care services; and

(2) A corporation or private agency that contracts directly with the department of human services to provide attendant care and day care services authorized under the Social Security Act, as amended.

"Wages" means all remuneration for services from whatever source, including commissions, bonuses, tips or gratuities received in the course of employment from others than the employer to the extent that they are customary and expected in that type of employment and reported to the employer for payroll tax deduction purposes, and the cash value of all remuneration in any medium other than cash.

The director may issue regulations for the reasonable determination of the cash value of remuneration in any medium other than cash.

Wages do not include the amount of any payment specified in section 383-11.

"Weekly benefit amount" means the amount payable under this chapter for a period of continuous disability throughout a calendar week. If the period of disability or the initial or terminal portion thereof is shorter than a calendar week, the benefit amount payable for that portion shall be the weekly benefit amount multiplied by a factor consisting of a quotient having the number of workdays lost during the portion of the week for the enumerator and the number of regular workdays of the employee during a calendar week for the denominator.
