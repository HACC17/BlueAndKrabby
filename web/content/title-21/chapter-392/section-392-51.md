**[ยง392-51] Failure to submit timely wage and employment information.** An employer to whom an insurer has sent a request for information on wages, hours, and duration of employment regarding an employee claiming disability benefits shall complete and submit such information within seven days from the date the request was received. If the employer fails to submit such information within seven days, the director upon notification by the insurer shall levy a penalty of $10 for each delinquent request where the employer fails to show good cause for failure to file on time.
