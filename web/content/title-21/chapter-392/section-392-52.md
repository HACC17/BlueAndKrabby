**ยง392-52 Disposition of accrued benefits where insurer is unable to locate employee.** An insurer who is unable to pay benefits to an employee because the employee cannot be located, shall deposit the accrued benefits into the trust fund for disability benefits. Upon locating the employee, the director shall pay from the trust fund to the employee an amount equal to but not more than the amount paid into the fund by the employer. If the employee cannot be located for a period of two years from the date of deposit, the employee's unpaid benefits shall escheat to the trust fund for disability benefits.
