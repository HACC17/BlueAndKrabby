**ยง381-8 Procedure where dispute not resolved.** For the ten-day period after the report of the emergency board has been filed with the governor, there shall be no strike or lockout. If no agreement is reached within the ten-day period, then at any time within a further period of twenty days, the representative of the employees may call the employees out on strike, or if the employees are unrepresented, the employees may proceed to go out on strike, and the public utility shall be free to lock out.

If during this period of twenty days a strike is not called or the employees fail to go on strike or the public utility does not engage in a lockout, there shall be no strike or lockout for a further period of thirty days.

If the parties fail to reach agreement within the thirty-day period, the employees shall thereafter be free to strike and the public utility to lock out, but not until notice of intent is first filed with the director of labor and industrial relations and ten days elapse from the date the notice is filed. The notice of intent may not be filed until the expiration of the thirty-day period. [L 1949, c 146, pt of ยง1; RL 1955, ยง91-9; [HRS ยง381-8](/title-21/chapter-381/section-381-8/)]
