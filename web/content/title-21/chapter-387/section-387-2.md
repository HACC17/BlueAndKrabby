Case Notes

Defendants not entitled to summary judgment; in appropriate circumstances, porterage may be considered in the nature of "gratuities" for the purposes of §387-1 and this section; plaintiffs raised genuine issue of material fact as to whether "porterage" is a "gratuity of any kind". 78 H. 351, 893 P.2d 779 (1995).
