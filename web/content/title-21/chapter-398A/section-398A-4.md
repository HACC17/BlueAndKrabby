**[****ยง398A-4] Restoration of employment.** An employer, upon expiration of a leave authorized by this chapter, shall restore an employee to the position held by the employee when the leave began or to a position with equivalent seniority status, employee benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. An employer may decline to restore an employee as required in this section because of conditions unrelated to the employee's exercise of rights under this chapter. [L 2014, c 161, pt of ยง1]
