[L 1915, c 16, §1; RL 1925, §2550; RL 1935, §3799; RL 1945, §9753; RL 1955, §219-13; [HRS §607-13](/title-32/chapter-607/section-607-13/); am L 1972, c 88, §5(p); gen ch 1985]

Case Notes

Section specifically addresses awarding of traveling expenses to a prevailing defendant and controls over general statute §607-9; defendant's traveling expenses thus limited to that mandated in this section. 88 H. 46, 961 P.2d 611 (1998).
