**[ยง607-15.5] Attorneys' fees in tort actions.** In all tort actions in which a judgment is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, attorneys' fees for both the plaintiff and the defendant shall be limited to a reasonable amount as approved by the court having jurisdiction of the action. In any tort action in which a settlement is effected, the plaintiff or the defendant may request that the amount of their respective attorneys' fees be subject to approval of the court having jurisdiction of the action.
