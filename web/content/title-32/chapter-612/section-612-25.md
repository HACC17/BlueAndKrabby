**[ยง612-25] Protection of jurors' employment.** (a) An employer shall not deprive an employee of the employee's employment, or threaten or otherwise coerce the employee with respect thereto, because the employee receives a summons, responds thereto, serves as a juror, or attends court for prospective jury service.

(b) Any employer who violates subsection (a) is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.

(c) If an employer discharges an employee in violation of subsection (a) the employee within ninety days from the date of discharge may bring a civil action for recovery of wages lost as a result of the violation and for an order requiring the reinstatement of the employee. Damages recoverable shall not exceed lost wages for six weeks. If the employee prevails, the employee shall be allowed a reasonable attorney's fee fixed by the court. [L 1973, c 191, pt of ยง1; gen ch 1985]
