**§612-7 Excused when, for cause.** A prospective juror shall not be excused by a court for slight or trivial cause, but only when it appears that jury duty would entail a serious personal hardship, or that for other good cause the prospective juror should be excused either temporarily or otherwise. [L 1973, c 191, pt of §1; gen ch 1985; am L 2007, c 122, §4]

Case Notes

Order excusing a juror from further duty is in the discretion of the court and cannot be reversed by mandamus. 13 H. 332 (1901); 21 H. 66 (1912).

Where prospective juror was prosecutor currently employed by same office as prosecutor trying the defendant, court shall imply bias as a matter of law and dismiss prospective juror for cause. 86 H. 195, 948 P.2d 1036 (1997).

Blood relationship between juror's and defendant's families was not "slight or trivial cause"; thus, it was within court's discretion to excuse juror for cause. 93 H. 344 (App.), 3 P.3d 510 (2000).
