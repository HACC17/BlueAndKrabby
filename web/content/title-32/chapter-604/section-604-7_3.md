**ยง604-7.3 Change of venue.** After the parties shall have had an opportunity to be heard, any district court may, in its discretion, upon satisfactory proof that it would be more fair and equitable to the parties thereto if any civil case pending in the court were heard in another jurisdiction, change the venue to the district court of some other circuit and order the record to be transferred thereto; provided that any district court may, in its discretion, upon the consent of all the parties to any civil or criminal case pending in the court, change the venue to the district court of some other circuit and order the record to be transferred thereto. [L 1971, c 144, ยง4]
