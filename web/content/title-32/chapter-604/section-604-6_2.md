**§604-6.2 Order to show cause.**  _[Repeal and reenactment on June 30, 2020\. L 2015, c 101, §4.]_ Upon the filing of a complaint with a copy of a lease or rental contract and an affidavit sworn to by the plaintiff or some competent affiant setting forth a statement of facts sufficient to show that the leased or rented personal property has been in the defendant's possession at least fourteen days after the termination of the lease or rental contract, either by passage of time or by reason of any default under the terms and conditions of the lease or rental contract, the court may issue an order directing the defendant to either return the leased or rented personal property to the plaintiff or to appear and show cause for the possession at such time as the court shall direct, but not later than ten days from the date of service of the order to show cause.  The order to show cause shall also provide that, if the leased or rented personal property is not returned to the plaintiff prior to the hearing, the defendant shall, if reasonably feasible, produce the property at the hearing.  If, at the hearing, it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the leased or rented personal property, it shall issue an order directed to the sheriff, deputy sheriff, police officer, or independent civil process server from the department of public safety's list under section 353C-10 commanding the sheriff, deputy sheriff, police officer, or independent civil process server to seize the personal property therein described and to deliver the same to the plaintiff or the plaintiff's agent.  Service of the order to show cause shall be as provided by law or rule of court for cases in the district courts, or by registered mail or by certified mail with return receipt showing delivery within the State.
