**DIVISION 4\. COURTS AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS**

Note

Pursuant to article VI, section 7 of the state constitution, the supreme court promulgated rules having the force and effect of law. Statutes relating to process, practice, procedure, and appeals remain in force and effect if, but only if, they are not in conflict with the rules of court. Accordingly, the procedural statutes set out in this division should be compared with the rules of court to ascertain whether they have been superseded in whole or in part. As to applicability of rules, see HRCP rules 1 and 81; HRPP rules 1 and 54; RCC rules 1.1, 32, and 34; HAR rule 2; RDC rules 1.1 and 31; DCRCP rules 1 and 81; RSCD rule 1; HFCR rules 1 and 81; HRAP rules 1, 2, and 2.1; see also Rules of the Supreme Court, Hawaii Rules of Professional Conduct, Hawaii Revised Code of Judicial Conduct, Rules of the Intermediate Court of Appeals, Rules of the Tax Appeal Court, and Rules of the Land Court.
