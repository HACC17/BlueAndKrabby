(2) An appeal from a decision of any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law:

(A) Invalidating an amendment to the state constitution; or

(3) A sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

(b) The supreme court, in a manner and within the time provided by the rules of court, may grant an application to transfer any case within the jurisdiction of the intermediate appellate court to the supreme court upon the grounds that the case involves:
