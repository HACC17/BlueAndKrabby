**[ยง302A-127]** **Board of education; senate advice and consent.** In determining whether to confirm the governor's nominees to the board, the senate shall consider the combination of abilities, breadth of experiences, and characteristics of the board, as a whole, that will best serve the diverse interests and needs of the students and their families, the education system in Hawaii from early childhood through higher education, and the public libraries. Such considerations shall include but not be limited to reflecting the diversity of the student population, geographical representation, and a broad representation of education-related stakeholders.
