This declaration does not affect the rights of the minor's parent, guardian, or legal custodian regarding the care, custody, and control of the minor, and does not give the caregiver legal custody of the minor.

The minor's parent or legal custodian may at any time rescind this affidavit by informing the minor's school principal in writing that the minor is attending school under the authority of this affidavit and that this affidavit has been rescinded.

A person who relies on this affidavit has no obligation to conduct any further inquiry or investigation.

No person who relies in good faith on this affidavit shall be subject to civil or criminal liability or to professional disciplinary action because of that reliance."
