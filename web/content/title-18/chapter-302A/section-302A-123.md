Attorney General Opinions

This statute, providing that a holdover member shall serve until a successor has been "appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate", is constitutional; the state constitution explicitly grants the legislature the authority to regulate the board in this manner. Att. Gen. Op. 16-3.
