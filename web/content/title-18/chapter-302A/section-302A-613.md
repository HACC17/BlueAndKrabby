Teachers and educational officers of the State so exchanged shall be paid their regular salaries. The qualifications of all teachers and educational officers from any such state, country, or territory so exchanged shall be equal to the qualifications of the teachers and educational officers exchanged by the State. In the selection of teachers and educational officers to be exchanged, preference shall be given in the following order: teachers over educational officers; principals and vice-principals over other educational officers.

(b) All teachers and educational officers so exchanged by the State shall be furnished transportation to and from the state, country, or territory with which exchanged.

(c) No compensation shall be paid by the State to teachers and educational officers exchanged from any other state, country, or territory; provided that in any case where the exchanged teacher or educational officer sent from Hawaii becomes incapacitated or, for any reason, leaves the exchange position permanently, the department may pay the visiting exchange teacher or educational officer an amount not to exceed the salary rating of the teacher or educational officer on exchange from Hawaii.
