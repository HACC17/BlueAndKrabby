**§302A-1134.6 Zero tolerance policy**. (a) Any child who possesses, sells, or uses a dangerous weapon or switchblade knife, while attending school or while attending department-supervised activities held on or off school property, may be excluded from attending school for up to ninety-two school days, as determined by the principal and approved by the superintendent or other individuals designated pursuant to rules adopted by the board.

(b) Except as provided in subsection (f), any child who possesses, sells, consumes, or uses intoxicating liquor or illegal drugs, while attending school or while attending department-supervised activities held on or off school property, may be excluded from attending school for up to ninety-two school days, as determined by the principal and approved by the superintendent or other individuals designated pursuant to rules adopted by the board.

(c) Except as provided in subsection (f), any child who reasonably appears to have consumed or used intoxicating liquor or illegal drugs prior to attending school or attending department-supervised activities held on or off school property, may be excluded from attending school for up to ninety-two school days, as determined by the principal and approved by the superintendent or other individuals designated pursuant to rules adopted by the board.

(d) In any case of exclusion from school, the due process procedures as set forth in the provisions of Hawaii administrative rules relating to student discipline shall apply.

(e) If a child is excluded from attending school for more than ten days, the superintendent or the superintendent's designee shall ensure that substitute educational activities or other appropriate assistance are provided, such as referral for appropriate intervention and treatment services, as determined by the principal in consultation with the appropriate school staff.

(f) A child determined to be in violation of subsection (b) or (c) shall be subject to the department's disciplinary rules; provided that:

(1) The school shall administer a screening tool approved by the department to determine whether there is a need for the child to be referred for a substance abuse assessment;

(2) The child shall be allowed to return to school earlier than the department's original disciplinary determination; provided that the child gives the school evidence of the following:

(A) A substance abuse assessment has been completed; and

(B) The child is progressing toward clinical discharge from any substance abuse treatment or substance abuse counseling recommended by the substance abuse assessment;

(3) If the substance abuse assessment finds that the child does not need substance abuse treatment or substance abuse counseling, the school may allow the child to return to school earlier than originally indicated; provided that:

(A) The child provides a certified copy of the assessment; and

(B) The child's parent or legal guardian consents to the child and the child's family receiving follow-up counseling or other student support services to be provided by the department.

In determining whether to allow the child to return to school early, the school administrator shall review and determine the nature and severity of the offense, the impact of the offense on others, the age of the offender, and whether the offender is a repeat offender; and

(4) For the child's first violation of subsection (b) or (c), if the child provides evidence of clinical discharge from the substance abuse treatment program or substance abuse counseling, all records of disciplinary action relating to the original offense shall be expunged. For the purposes of this paragraph, "expunged" means the records of substance abuse assessment shall be segregated and kept confidential but shall be destroyed upon graduation of the child.

(g) For purposes of this section:

"Dangerous weapon" means a dirk, dagger, butterfly knife, blackjack, slug shot, billy, metal knuckles, or other instrument whose sole design and purpose is to inflict bodily injury or death; provided that firearms are excluded from this definition.
