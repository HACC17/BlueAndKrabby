The payments shall be made in regular monthly installments, the last two of which shall not be made until after the teacher or educational officer has returned to the teacher's or educational officer's position in the department. A teacher or educational officer granted sabbatical leave may engage in any form of employment provided the conditions established in section 302A-616 are fulfilled. [L 1996, c 89, pt of ยง2]
