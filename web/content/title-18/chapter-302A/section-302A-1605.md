**ยง302A-1605 Impact fee analysis.** Upon designation of a school impact district, the department shall prepare an impact fee analysis that shall include, at a minimum, an analysis including the advantages and disadvantages of potential changes to statewide school site areas and design enrollment standards that may be appropriate for application in the particular school impact district. This analysis may include, for example, non-traditional facilities such as mid-rise or high-rise structures in existing urban areas where new residential developments are expected to generate the need for new school construction.
