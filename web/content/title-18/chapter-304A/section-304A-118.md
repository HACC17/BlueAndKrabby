**[§304A-118]  Graduation pathway system.** (a) The university shall provide guidance to students to increase the rate of on-time graduation. In providing such guidance, the university shall develop a graduation pathway system to direct students toward appropriate options to complete a major course of study, graduate within a reasonable period of time, and understand the dynamics of the local employment market.

(b) In developing the graduation pathway system, the university shall include elements such as structured, default pathways to graduation; academic maps with sequential scheduling of classes; intrusive advising; data on the dynamics of the local employment market, including the availability of employment; and other elements as appropriate to provide guidance to students toward timely graduation.
