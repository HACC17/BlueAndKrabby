(2) No liability shall attach to the board or any officer or agent thereof or the State or any officer thereof, including any fiscal agent, paying agent, or registrar for revenue bonds, by reason of the numbers or any use made thereof, including any use thereof made by the board or any officer or agent thereof, the State, any officer or agent thereof, or by reason of any inaccuracy, error, or omission.

The board may require that all costs of obtaining and printing the CUSIP identification numbers shall be paid by the purchaser of the revenue bonds. [L 2007, c 161, pt of ยง1]
