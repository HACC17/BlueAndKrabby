**ยง304A-2253 Research and training revolving fund.** (a) There is established a University of Hawaii research and training revolving fund into which shall be deposited one hundred per cent of the total amount of indirect overhead revenues generated by the university from research and training programs. The board of regents is authorized to expend one hundred per cent of the revenues deposited in the fund for:

(1) Research and training purposes that may result in additional research and training grants and contracts;

(2) Facilitating research and training at the university; and

(3) Further deposit into the discoveries and inventions special fund.

(b) The annual report required to be made for this revolving fund shall include but not be limited to a breakdown of travel expenses.

(c) Notwithstanding section 304A-107 to the contrary, the board of regents, or its designee, may establish a separate account within the research and training revolving fund for the purpose of providing advance funding to meet reimbursable costs incurred in connection with federally financed research and training projects. Any reimbursement received as a result of providing advance funding shall be deposited into the research and training revolving fund to be used for the purpose of meeting reimbursable costs incurred in connection with federally financed projects.

(d) Revenues deposited into the fund shall not be used as a basis for reducing any current or future budget request or allotment to the university unless the university requests such a reduction. [L 2006, c 75, pt of ยง2; am L 2011, c 124, ยง5; am L 2015, c 106, ยง11]
