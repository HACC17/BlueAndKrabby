At the direction of the board, there may be established accounts in the university revenue-undertakings fund as required by the resolution authorizing revenue bonds.

If revenue bonds are issued under subpart D of part VI payable from the revenue of a university parking facility or the revenue of a university system that includes a university parking facility, the board in the resolution authorizing revenue bonds may direct that all or any part of the moneys required by this chapter to be paid into the university parking revolving fund created by section 304A-2275 shall be deposited in the university revenue-undertakings fund in lieu of being deposited in the university parking revolving fund.

(b) All moneys in the university revenue-undertakings fund shall be applied in accordance with the resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds under subpart D of part VI, as follows:

(1) To provide for all costs of construction, operation, repair, and maintenance of a university project, university system, network, or any combination thereof, including reserves therefor;

(2) To pay when due all revenue bonds and interest thereon, for the payment of which all or any part of the revenue of the university is or has been pledged, charged, or otherwise encumbered, including reserves therefor;

(4) To reimburse the general fund of the State for principal and interest on general obligation bonds issued for all university projects, university systems, networks, or any combination thereof, or issued to refund any of such general obligation bonds, to the extent required by law; and

(5) To provide a reserve for betterments and improvements to and renewals and replacements of, university projects, university systems, networks, or any combination thereof.

If adequate provision is made for all the foregoing purposes, and if permitted by law and the covenants in the resolution authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds under subpart D of part VI, any moneys remaining in the university revenue-undertakings fund at the end of a fiscal year may be expended by the board in subsequent years in furtherance of any of the purposes of the university.
