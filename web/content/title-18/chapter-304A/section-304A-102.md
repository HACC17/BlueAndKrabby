**[§304A-102] Purposes of the university.** The purposes of the university are to give thorough instruction and conduct research in, and disseminate knowledge of, agriculture, mechanic arts, mathematical, physical, natural, economic, political, and social sciences, languages, literature, history, philosophy, and such other branches of advanced learning as the board of regents from time to time may prescribe and to give such military instruction as the board of regents may prescribe and that the federal government requires. The standard of instruction shall be equal to that given and required in similar universities on the mainland United States. Upon the successful completion of prescribed courses, the board of regents may confer a corresponding degree upon every student who becomes entitled thereto. [L 2006, c 75, pt of §2]
