**[ยง304A-3152] Commission's powers and authority.** (a) The commission may cooperate with the federal government to qualify the State to receive funds made available under the Higher Education Act of 1965, Public Law 89-329, as amended from time to time, and in addition may serve as the state agency for the receipt of federal funds when federal legislation dealing with higher education or post-secondary education requires, as a condition of state receipt of such funds, the designation of a state agency that is broadly representative of the general public and of post-secondary education in the State and when agencies other than the commission created by this subpart may not qualify. The commission shall adopt appropriate rules not inconsistent with this subpart as may be required to administer this subpart. The rules shall be adopted in accordance with chapter 91.

(b) No funds appropriated by the legislature may be used to aid a person attending an institution not owned or exclusively controlled by the State or a department of the State or to pay for any staff work distributing federal or private funds to students attending such schools. The maximum amount of any grant awarded under the Hawaii state incentive grant program shall be equal to the maximum allowed by federal law. [L 2006, c 75, pt of ยง2]
