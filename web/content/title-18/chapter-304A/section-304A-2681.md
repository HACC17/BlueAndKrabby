(3) To reimburse the general fund of the State for principal and interest on general obligation bonds issued for university projects, university systems, or networks or any combination thereof, or to refund general obligation bonds, to the extent required by law; and

(4) To carry out all covenants and provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds.

(b) Nothing in this subpart shall preclude the making of appropriations to the university or board, including any appropriation, or the acceptance of gifts by the board or the use of funds derived from the sale of stocks, bonds, or other assets in the possession of the board to pay all or part of the cost of construction or maintenance of any or all university projects, university systems, or networks.
