**[ยง304A-2155] Library special fund.** There is established a library special fund for the libraries of the University of Hawaii into which shall be deposited all fines, fees, and other revenue derived from the libraries' operations. Moneys deposited in this fund may be expended to replace or repair lost, damaged, stolen, or outdated books, serials, and periodicals or to support and improve the services provided by the libraries. The amounts allocated to each campus library from the special fund shall be proportionate to the amount of revenues generated by each library. [L 2006, c 75, pt of ยง2]
