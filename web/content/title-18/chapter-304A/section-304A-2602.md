The owner of any vehicle so towed away shall be responsible for and pay all costs incurred in the towing and storage. Any vehicle towed away and unclaimed thirty days thereafter shall be sold at public auction by the university. The university shall pay all costs of towing and storage and other costs connected with the sale out of the university parking revolving fund established under section [304A-2275]. The fund shall be reimbursed for the costs from the proceeds of the sale, and the remaining balance, if any, shall be paid to the owner of the vehicle; provided that if the proceeds of the sale are not claimed by the owner of the vehicle within sixty days after notice, the proceeds shall be deposited in the university parking revolving fund.
