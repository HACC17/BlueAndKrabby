**ยง302D-33 Criminal history record checks.** (a) The authorizer shall require charter schools to obtain verifiable information regarding the criminal history of persons who are employed or seeking employment in any position, including teacher trainees, that places them in close proximity to children, including criminal history record checks in accordance with section 846-2.7\. Information obtained pursuant to this subsection shall be used exclusively by the charter school for the purpose of determining whether a person is suitable for working in close proximity to children. All such decisions shall be subject to applicable federal laws and regulations.

(b) The employer or prospective employer may:

(1) Refuse to allow or continue to allow teacher training;

(2) Terminate the employment of any employee; or

(3) Deny employment to an applicant,

if the person has committed a crime, and if the employer or prospective employer finds by reason of the nature and circumstances of the crime, that the person poses a risk to the health, safety, or well-being of children. Refusal, termination, or denial may occur only after appropriate investigation and notification to the employee or applicant of the results and planned action and after the employee or applicant is given an opportunity to meet and rebut the findings. Nothing in this subsection shall abrogate any applicable rights under chapter 76 or 89, or any administrative rule of the commission.

(c) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, for purposes of this section, the commission shall be exempt from section 831-3.1 and shall not be required to conduct investigations, notifications, or hearings in accordance with chapter 91\. [L 2013, c 159, pt of ยง1; am L 2015, c 114, ยง10]
