**ยง302D-31 Athletics.** The department shall provide students at charter schools, including students enrolled at charter schools whose curriculum incorporates virtual education, with the same opportunity to participate in athletics as is provided to students at department schools. If a student at any charter school wishes to participate in a sport for which there is no program at the charter school, the department shall allow that student to participate in a comparable program at the department school in the service area in which the student resides. All charter school students participating in athletics shall abide by all rules, regulations, and policies of the athletic league, association, and program applicable to the department school in whose athletic program the student is participating.
