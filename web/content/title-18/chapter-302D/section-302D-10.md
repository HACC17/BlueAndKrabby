**[ยง302D-10] Services purchased from authorizer; itemized accounting.** (a) No public charter school shall be required to purchase services from its authorizer as a condition of charter approval or renewal or of executing a charter contract, nor may any such condition be implied.

(b) A public charter school may, at its discretion, choose to purchase services from its authorizer. In such event, the public charter school and authorizer shall execute an annual service contract, separate from the charter contract, stating the parties' mutual agreement concerning any services to be provided by the authorizer and any service fees to be charged to the public charter school. An authorizer may not charge more than market rates for services provided to a public charter school. [L 2012, c 130, pt of ยง2]
