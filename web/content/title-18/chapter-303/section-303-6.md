**[ยง303-6]** **Participation in qualified football coaches pension plan.** The University of Hawaii, on behalf of any of its football coaches, may enter into a written agreement with any association of football coaches with a qualified coaches plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, for the purpose of enabling its football coaches to participate in the association's qualified pension plan. The University of Hawaii may withhold sums from a participating football coach's salary and pay those sums directly to the qualified coaches plan if withholding and payment are required under the plan.
