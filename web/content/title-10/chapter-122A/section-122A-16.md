**[ยง122A-16] Courts-martial; nonjudicial punishment.** Any limitations in chapter 124A to the contrary notwithstanding, whenever this chapter specifically authorizes an act to be punished by court-martial or nonjudicial punishment, the court-martial may be convened or nonjudicial punishment imposed and punishment administered as though the act complained of were a violation of the punitive articles of chapter 124A.
