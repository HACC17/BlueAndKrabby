Case Notes

Where plaintiff asserted that §§134-6 and 134-9 violated rights guaranteed by Article I and the Second, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, defendants' motions to dismiss plaintiff's complaint granted; among other things, plaintiff did not have standing to challenge this chapter on the basis of an alleged deprivation of Second Amendment or Ninth Amendment rights, this chapter is not an impermissible bill of attainder with respect to plaintiff, and this chapter imposes no impairment of a contractual right possessed by plaintiff. 548 F. Supp. 2d 1151.

Defendant could not claim that state firearms regulations infringed upon rights protected by Second Amendment. 82 H. 143, 920 P.2d 357.

Right to bear arms may be regulated by the State in a reasonable manner. 82 H. 143, 920 P.2d 357.

Appellate court precluded from remanding convictions for retrial as no lesser included offense of a felon in possession of a firearm or ammunition under this chapter. 82 H. 517 (App.), 923 P.2d 934.
