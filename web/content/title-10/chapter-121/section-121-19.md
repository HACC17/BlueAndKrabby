**§121-19 Regulations governing armories, etc.** Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, the adjutant general may make regulations to establish procedures governing the care and custody of armories, rifle ranges, reservations and installations that are either set aside to the department of defense or on license from the federal government. The adjutant general may permit the use of or may temporarily rent to civic, community, veterans and other nonprofit public organizations and groups, such portions of armories, rifle ranges, reservations and installations as will not interfere with the military use thereof. The adjutant general shall establish the rentals to be charged for their use and all moneys received from the rentals shall be deposited into the general fund of the State. Chapter 91 shall not apply. [L 1967, c 196, pt of §1; [HRS §121-19](/title-10/chapter-121/section-121-19/); am L 1975, c 108, §2; gen ch 1985]

Attorney General Opinions

Allowance of use of armories for private functions must be in accordance with this section if armories are on license from the federal government, and in accordance with §171-11 if armories are on lands set aside by executive orders. Att. Gen. Op. 71-1.
