**[****§****132D-16.6]  Display site inspection.** Each county fire chief is authorized to conduct inspections of the persons conducting a display, including the site where the display is occurring or will occur within the fire chief's county to determine compliance with the applicable county code and the current editions of the National Fire Protection Association's "NFPA 1123: Code for Fireworks Display" and "NFPA 1126: Standard for the Use of Pyrotechnics Before a Proximate Audience". An inspection fee of $200 shall be assessed by the county upon the holder of a permit for a display under section 132D-10(2), which shall be separate from the display permit fee under that section. The inspection fee shall be paid to the county in which the display will occur, and shall be used to defray the cost of the official conducting the inspection of the display setup.
