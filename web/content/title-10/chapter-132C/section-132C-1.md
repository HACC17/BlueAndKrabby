**[ยง132C-1] Purpose.** It is the intent of this chapter to require that only reduced ignition propensity cigarettes be sold in the State. Although these cigarettes are not guaranteed to self-extinguish, they are expected to reduce accidental fires and related personal injury and property damage caused by cigarette smoking.
