(B) Establish other task forces and advisory groups, as may be deemed necessary, to assist in the preparation and review of the biennial state energy emergency preparedness plan;

(3) The biennial state energy emergency preparedness plan shall be comprehensive and encompassing, and shall integrate into its analytic and planning framework the plans of electric and gas utilities and other energy suppliers, relevant state agencies, including the department of transportation, counties, and such other entities as deemed appropriate; and

(4) The biennial state energy emergency preparedness plan shall include a review and update of the previous biennial state energy emergency preparedness plan and a review of the energy emergency plans prepared by the counties.
