**[ยง124A-66] Challenges.** (a) Members of a general or special court-martial and the law officer of a general court-martial may be challenged by the accused or the trial counsel for cause stated to the court. The court shall determine the relevancy and validity of challenges for cause, and may not receive a challenge to more than one person at a time. Challenges by the trial counsel shall ordinarily be presented and decided before those by the accused are offered.

(b) Each accused and the trial counsel is entitled to one preemptory challenge, but the law officer may not be challenged except for cause. [L 1982, c 171, pt of ยง2]
