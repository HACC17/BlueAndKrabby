**[ยง124A-34] Jurisdiction of special courts-martial.** Subject to section 124A-32, special courts-martial have jurisdiction to try persons subject to this chapter for any offense for which they may be punished under this chapter. A special court-martial has the same powers of punishment as a general court-martial, except that a fine imposed by a special court-martial may not be more than $100 for a single offense.
