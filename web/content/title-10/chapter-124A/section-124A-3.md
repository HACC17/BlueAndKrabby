**[ยง124A-3] Jurisdiction to try certain personnel.** (a) Each person discharged from the state military forces who is later charged with having fraudulently obtained the person's discharge is, subject to section 124A-68, subject to trial by court-martial on that charge and is after apprehension subject to this chapter while in the custody of the military for that trial. Upon conviction of that charge the person is subject to trial by court-martial for all offenses under this chapter committed before the fraudulent discharge.

(b) No person who has deserted from the state military forces may be relieved from amenability to the jurisdiction of this chapter by virtue of a separation from any later period of service. [L 1982, c 171, pt of ยง2; gen ch 1985]
