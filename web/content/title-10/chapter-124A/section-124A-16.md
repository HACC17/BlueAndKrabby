(b) Every commander of a guard, master at arms, warden, keeper, or officer of a state correctional facility designated under section 124A-15, to whose charge a prisoner is committed shall, within twenty-four hours after that commitment or as soon as he is relieved from guard, report to the commanding officer of the prisoner the name of the prisoner, the offense charged against him, and the name of the person who ordered or authorized the commitment.
