**[ยง124A-96] Approval by the convening authority.** In acting on the findings and sentence of a court-martial, the convening authority may approve only such findings of guilty, and the sentence or such part or amount of the sentence, as the convening authority finds correct in law and fact and as the convening authority in the convening authority's discretion determines should be approved. Unless the convening authority indicates otherwise, approval of the sentence is approval of the findings and sentence. [L 1982, c 171, pt of ยง2; gen ch 1985]
