**[§124A-55] Advice of state judge advocate and reference for trial.** (a) Before directing the trial of any charge by general court-martial, the convening authority shall refer it to the state judge advocate for consideration and advice. The convening authority may not refer a charge to a general court-martial for trial unless the convening authority has found that the charge alleges an offense under this chapter and is warranted by evidence indicated in the report of the investigation.

(b) If the charges or specifications are not formally correct or do not conform to the substance of the evidence contained in the report of the investigating officer, formal corrections and such changes in the charges and specifications as are needed to make them conform to the evidence may be made. [L 1982, c 171, pt of §2; gen ch 1985]
