**[ยง124A-18] Delivery of offenders to civil authorities.** (a) Under such rules as may be adopted under this chapter, a person subject to this chapter who is on active state duty or on duty status other than active state duty who is accused of an offense against civil authority may be delivered, upon request, to the civil authority for trial.

(b) When delivery under this section is made to any civil authority of a person undergoing sentence of a court-martial, the delivery, if followed by conviction in a civil tribunal, interrupts the execution of the sentence of the court-martial, and the offender after having answered to the civil authorities for the offender's offense shall, upon the request of competent military authority, be returned to military custody for the completion of the offender's sentence.
