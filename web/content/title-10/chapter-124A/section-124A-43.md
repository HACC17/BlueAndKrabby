**[ยง124A-43] Summary courts-martial of state military forces not in federal service; who may convene.** (a) In the state military forces not in federal service, the commanding officer of a garrison, fort, post, camp, air base, auxiliary air base, or other place where troops are on duty, or of a brigade, regiment, wing, group, detached battalion, detached squadron, detached company, or other detachment, may convene a summary court-martial consisting of one commissioned officer. The proceedings shall be informal.

(b) When only one commissioned officer is present with a command or detachment the officer shall be the summary court-martial of that command or detachment and shall hear and determine all summary court-martial cases brought before the officer. Summary courts-martial may, however, be convened in any case by superior competent authority when considered desirable by the superior authority. [L 1982, c 171, pt of ยง2; gen ch 1985]
