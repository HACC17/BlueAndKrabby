The amount of such fine may be noted upon any state roll or account for pay of the delinquent and deducted from any pay or allowance due or thereafter to become due the delinquent, until the fine is liquidated. Any sum so deducted shall be returned to the military court which imposed the fine. The officer collecting a fine or penalty imposed by a military court upon an officer or enlisted person shall pay it within thirty days to the director of finance to the credit of the state general fund.
