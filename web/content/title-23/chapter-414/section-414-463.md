**[ยง414-463] Appeal from revocation.** (a) A foreign corporation may appeal the department director's revocation of its certificate of authority to the circuit court within thirty days after the certificate of revocation is signed. The foreign corporation appeals by petitioning the court to set aside the revocation and attaching to the petition copies of its certificate of authority and the department director's certificate of revocation.

(b) The court may summarily order the department director to reinstate the certificate of authority or may take any other action the court considers appropriate.

(c) The court's final decision may be appealed as in other civil proceedings. [L 2000, c 244, pt of ยง1]
