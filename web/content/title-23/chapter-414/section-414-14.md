**ยง414-14 Effective time and date of document.** (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) and section 414-15(c), a document accepted for filing is effective at the time of filing on the date it is filed, as evidenced by the department director's date and time endorsement on the original document.

(b) Articles of dissolution, articles of conversion, and articles of merger or share exchange may specify a delayed effective time and date, and if it does so the document becomes effective at the time and date specified. If a delayed effective date but no time is specified, the document is effective at the close of business on that date. A delayed effective date for a document may not be later than the thirtieth day after the date it is filed. [L 2000, c 244, pt of ยง1; am L 2001, c 129, ยง11; am L 2002, c 130, ยง9]
