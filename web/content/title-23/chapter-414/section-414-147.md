**[ยง414-147] Action by single and multiple voting groups.** (a) If the articles of incorporation or this chapter provide for voting by a single voting group on a matter, action on that matter is taken when voted upon by that voting group as provided in section 414-146.

(b) If the articles of incorporation or this chapter provide for voting by two or more voting groups on a matter, action on that matter is taken only when voted upon by each of those voting groups counted separately as provided in section 414-146\. Action may be taken by one voting group on a matter even though no action is taken by another voting group entitled to vote on the matter. [L 2000, c 244, pt of ยง1]
