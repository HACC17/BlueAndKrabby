**[ยง414-194] Election of directors by certain classes of shareholders.** If the articles of incorporation authorize dividing the shares into classes, the articles may also authorize the election of all or a specified number of directors by the holders of one or more authorized classes of shares. A class or classes of shares entitled to elect one or more directors is a separate voting group for purposes of the election of directors. [L 2000, c 244, pt of ยง1]
