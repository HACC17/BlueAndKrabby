**ยง414-85 Share options.** A corporation may issue rights, options, or warrants for the purchase of shares of the corporation. The board of directors shall determine the terms upon which the rights, options, or warrants are issued, their form and content, and the consideration for which the shares are to be issued. The documents evidencing such rights, options, or warrants may include conditions that preclude the holder or holders, including any subsequent transferees, of at least a specified percentage of the common shares of a corporation from exercising such rights, options, or warrants.
