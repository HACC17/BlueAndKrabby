**ยง414-404 Appeal from denial of reinstatement.** (a) If the department director denies a corporation's application for reinstatement following administrative dissolution, the department director shall mail a written notice to the corporation or its designated representative that explains the reason or reasons for denial.

(b) The corporation may appeal the denial of reinstatement to the circuit court within thirty days after the notice of denial is mailed. The corporation may appeal by petitioning the court to set aside the dissolution and attaching to the petition copies of the department director's certificate of dissolution, the corporation's application for reinstatement, and the department director's notice of denial.

(c) The court may summarily order the department director to reinstate the dissolved corporation or may take other action the court considers appropriate.

(d) The court's final decision may be appealed as in other civil proceedings. [L 2000, c 244, pt of ยง1; am L 2003, c 124, ยง10]
