**ยง414-434 Change of name by foreign corporation.** (a) Whenever the name of a foreign corporation authorized to transact business in this State is changed by the amendment of its articles of incorporation, the foreign corporation, within sixty days after the amendment becomes effective, shall deliver to the department director a certificate evidencing the name change, duly authenticated by the proper officer of the state or country under the laws of which it is incorporated. If the certificate is in a foreign language, a translation under oath of the translator shall accompany the certificate.

(b) Whenever a foreign corporation that is authorized to transact business in this State shall change its name to one under which a certificate of authority would not be granted to it on application therefor, the foreign corporation shall not thereafter transact any business in this State until it has changed its name to a name that is available to it under the laws of this State or has otherwise complied with this chapter.

(c) If a foreign corporation is unable to change its name to a name that is available to it under the laws of this State, it may deliver to the department director a copy of a certificate of registration of a trade name and thereafter shall become authorized to transact business in the State under that name.
