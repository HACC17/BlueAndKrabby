**ยง414-412 Procedure for judicial dissolution.** (a) Venue for a proceeding by the attorney general to dissolve a corporation lies in circuit court. Venue for a proceeding brought by any other party named in section 414-411 lies in the county where a corporation's principal office is or was located (or, if none in this State, in the city and county of Honolulu).

(b) It is not necessary to make shareholders parties to a proceeding to dissolve a corporation unless relief is sought against them individually.

(c) A court in a proceeding brought to dissolve a corporation may issue injunctions, appoint a receiver or custodian pendente lite with all powers and duties the court directs, take other action required to preserve the corporate assets wherever located, and carry on the business of the corporation until a full hearing can be held.

(d) Within ten days after the commencement of a proceeding under section 414-411(2) to dissolve a corporation that has no shares listed on a national securities exchange or regularly traded in a market maintained by one or more members of a national or affiliated securities association, the corporation must send to all shareholders, other than the petitioner, a notice stating that the shareholders are entitled to avoid the dissolution of the corporation by electing to purchase the petitioner's shares under section 414-415 and accompanied by a copy of section 414-415\.
