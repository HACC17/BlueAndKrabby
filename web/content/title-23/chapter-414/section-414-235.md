**[ยง414-235] Contract rights of officers.** (a) The appointment or election of an officer does not itself create contract rights.

(b) An officer's removal does not affect the officer's contract rights, if any, with the corporation. An officer's resignation does not affect the corporation's contract rights, if any, with the officer. [L 2000, c 244, pt of ยง1]
