**ยง414-141 Shareholders' list for meeting.** (a) After fixing a record date for a meeting, a corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders who are entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting. The list shall be arranged by voting group (and within each voting group by class or series of shares) and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder.

(b) The shareholders' list shall be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting for which the list was prepared is given and continuing through the meeting, at the corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held, or on a reasonably accessible electronic network; provided that the information required to gain access to the shareholders' list is provided with the notice of the meeting. A shareholder, the shareholder's agent, or the shareholder's attorney, shall be entitled on written demand to inspect and to copy the list, during regular business hours and at the shareholder's expense, during the period it is available for inspection. If the corporation determines that the list will be made available on an electronic network, the corporation shall take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to shareholders of the corporation.

(c) The corporation shall make the shareholders' list available at the meeting, and any shareholder, the shareholder's agent, or shareholder's attorney, is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.

(d) If the corporation refuses to allow a shareholder, the shareholder's agent, or the shareholder's attorney, to inspect the shareholders' list before or at the meeting (or copy the list as permitted by subsection (b)), the circuit court, on application of the shareholder, may summarily order the inspection or copying at the corporation's expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete.

(e) Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the shareholders' list does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting. [L 2000, c 244, pt of ยง1; am L 2001, c 129, ยง21; am L 2002, c 130, ยง20]
