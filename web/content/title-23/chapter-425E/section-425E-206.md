**[ยง425E-**206]**** **Filing in the office of the director; effective time and date.** (a) A certified and executed certificate of limited partnership, any certificate of amendment or cancellation, or of any judicial decree of amendment or cancellation, an application for registration as a foreign limited partnership, or any certificate relating thereto, shall be delivered to the director for filing. A person who executes a certificate as an agent or fiduciary need not exhibit evidence of that person's authority as a prerequisite to filing. Unless the director finds that any certificate does not conform to law, upon receipt of all filing fees required by law, the director shall:

(1) Stamp the document with the word "Filed" and the date of delivery thereof; and

(2) File the document in the director's office.

(b) Upon the filing of a certificate of amendment or judicial decree of amendment in the office of the director, the certificate of limited partnership shall be amended as set forth therein, and upon the effective date of a certificate of cancellation or a judicial decree thereof, the certificate of limited partnership shall be canceled.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) and section 425E-207, a document accepted for filing shall be effective at the time of filing on the date it is filed, as evidenced by the director's date and time endorsement on the original document.

(d) Articles of conversion and articles of merger may specify a delayed effective time and date, and if so, the document becomes effective at the time and date specified. If a delayed effective date but no time is specified, the document shall be effective at the close of business on that date. A delayed effective date for a document shall not be later than the thirtieth day after the date it is filed. [L 2003, c 210, pt of ยง1]
