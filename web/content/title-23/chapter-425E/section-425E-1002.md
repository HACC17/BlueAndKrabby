**[ยง425E-**1002] Derivative action.**** A partner may maintain a derivative action to enforce a right of a limited partnership if:

(1) The partner first makes a demand on the general partners, requesting that they cause the limited partnership to bring an action to enforce the right, and the general partners do not bring the action within a reasonable time; or

(2) A demand would be futile. [L 2003, c 210, pt of ยง1]
