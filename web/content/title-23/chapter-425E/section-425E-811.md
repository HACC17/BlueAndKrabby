**ยง425E-**811 Appeal from denial of reinstatement.**** (a) If the director denies a limited partnership's application for reinstatement following administrative cancellation, the director shall notify the limited partnership of the reason or reasons for the denial.

(b) The limited partnership may appeal the denial of reinstatement to the circuit court within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of denial. The limited partnership may appeal by petitioning the court to set aside the cancellation and attaching to the petition copies of the director's declaration of cancellation the limited partnership's application for reinstatement, and the director's notice of denial.

(c) The court may summarily order the director to reinstate the administratively canceled limited partnership or may take other action the court considers appropriate.

(d) The court's final decision may be appealed as in other civil proceedings. [L 2003, c 210, pt of ยง1; am L 2006, c 184, ยง26; am L 2008, c 54, ยง8]
