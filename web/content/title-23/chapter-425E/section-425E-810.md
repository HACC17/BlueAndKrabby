**§425E-810 Reinstatement following administrative cancellation.** (a) A limited partnership that has been administratively canceled may apply to the director for reinstatement within two years after the effective date of cancellation. The application shall:

(1) Recite the name of the limited partnership and the effective date of its administrative cancellation;

(2) Contain all reports due and unfiled;

(3) Contain the payment of all delinquent fees and penalties; and

(4) Contain a certificate or other writing from the department of taxation indicating that all taxes owed by the limited partnership have been paid, a payment arrangement has been entered into, or the unpaid tax liabilities are being contested in an administrative or judicial appeal with the department of taxation.

(b) Within the applicable reinstatement period, should the name of the limited partnership, or a name substantially identical thereto, be registered or reserved by another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or limited liability partnership, or should the name or a name substantially identical thereto be registered as a trade name, trademark, or service mark, then reinstatement shall be allowed only upon the registration of a new name by the limited partnership pursuant to the amendment provisions of this chapter.

(c) When the reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative cancellation, and the limited partnership may resume carrying on its business as if the administrative cancellation had never occurred.
