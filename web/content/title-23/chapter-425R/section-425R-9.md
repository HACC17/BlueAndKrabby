(1) The name of the agent as currently listed under section 425R-5(a);

(2) If the name of the agent has changed, its new name;

(3) If the address of the agent has changed, the new address; and

(4) If the type or jurisdiction of organization of the agent has changed, the new type or jurisdiction of organization.

(b) The filing of a statement of change under subsection (a) is effective to change the information regarding the commercial registered agent with respect to each entity that has filed to be represented by the agent.

(c) A statement of change filed under this section takes effect on filing.

(d) A commercial registered agent shall promptly furnish each entity represented by it with notice in a record of the filing of a statement of change relating to the name or address of the agent and the changes made by the filing.

(e) If a commercial registered agent changes its address without filing a statement of change as required by this section within thirty days of the address change, the director may cancel the listing of the agent under section 425R-5\. A cancellation under this subsection has the same effect as a termination under section 425R-6\. Promptly after canceling the listing of an agent, the director shall serve notice in a record in the manner provided by law on:

(1) Each entity represented by the agent, stating that the agent has ceased to be an agent for service of process on the entity and that, until the entity appoints a new registered agent, service of process may be made on the entity as provided by law; and
