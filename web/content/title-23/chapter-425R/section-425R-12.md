**[ยง425R-12] Jurisdiction and venue.** The appointment or maintenance of a registered agent in the State does not by itself create the basis for personal jurisdiction over the represented entity in the State. The address of the agent does not determine venue in an action or proceeding involving the entity. [L 2009, c 55, pt of ยง1]
