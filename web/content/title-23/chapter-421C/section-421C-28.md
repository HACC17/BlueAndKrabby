**ยง421C-28 Books; review.** (a) Subject to subsection (b), every association shall keep a set of books of the association's business operations, which shall be reviewed at the end of each fiscal year by a certified public accountant who shall not be an officer, director, or employee of the association.

(b) Where the annual gross business income of an association amounts to less than $1,000,000 (which amount shall be adjusted for changes in the Consumer Price Index since May 15, 1982), the review need not be done by a certified public accountant but may be performed by a review committee of two individuals who shall not be employees, plus the association's treasurer.

(c) A written report of the review, which may include a statement of the amount of business transacted with members and the amount transacted with nonmembers, and which shall include a balance sheet of the association's income and expenses, shall be submitted to the annual meeting of the association.
