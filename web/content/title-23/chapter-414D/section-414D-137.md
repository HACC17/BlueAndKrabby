**[ยง414D-137] Resignation of directors.** (a) A director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the board of directors, its presiding officer, or to the president or secretary.

(b) A resignation is effective when the notice is effective, unless the notice specifies a later effective date. If a resignation is made effective at a later date, the board may fill the pending vacancy before the effective date if the board provides that the successor does not take office until the effective date.
