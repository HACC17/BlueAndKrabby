**[ยง414D-147] Quorum and voting.** (a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the articles, or the bylaws, a quorum of a board of directors consists of a majority of the directors in office immediately before a meeting begins. In no event may the articles or bylaws authorize a quorum of fewer than the greater of one-third of the number of directors in office or two directors.

(b) If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of directors present is the act of the board unless this chapter, the articles, or the bylaws require the vote of a greater number of directors. [L 2001, c 105, pt of ยง1]
