**ยง414D-6 Effective time and date of document.** (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) and section 414D-7(c), a document is effective:

(1) At the time of filing on the date it is filed, as evidenced by the department director's endorsement on the original document; or

(2) At the time specified in the document as its effective time on the date it is filed.

(b) Articles of dissolution, articles of conversion, and articles of merger may specify a delayed effective time and date, and if it does so the document becomes effective at the time and date specified. If a delayed effective date but no time is specified, the document is effective at the close of business on that date. A delayed effective date for a document may not be later than the thirtieth day after the date filed. [L 2001, c 105, pt of ยง1; am L 2003, c 124, ยง21]
