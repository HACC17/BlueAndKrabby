Except as provided in subsection (b), the waiver shall be in writing, signed by the director entitled to the notice, and filed with the minutes or the corporate records.

(b) A director's attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice of the meeting unless the director at the beginning of the meeting or prior to the vote on a matter not noticed in conformity with this chapter, the articles, or the bylaws, objects to lack of notice and does not thereafter vote for or assent to the objected to action.
