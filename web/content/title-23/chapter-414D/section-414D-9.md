**[ยง414D-9] Appeal from the department director's refusal to file document.** (a) If the department director refuses to file a document delivered for filing to the department director's office, the domestic or foreign corporation may within thirty days after the return of the document appeal the refusal to the circuit court. The appeal shall be commenced by petitioning the court to compel filing the document and by attaching to the petition the document and the department director's explanation of the refusal to file.

(b) The court may summarily order the department director to file the document or take other action the court considers appropriate.

(c) The court's final decision may be appealed as in other civil proceedings. [L 2001, c 105, pt of ยง1]
