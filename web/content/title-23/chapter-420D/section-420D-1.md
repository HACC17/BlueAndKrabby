**[ยง420D-1] Purpose and findings.** This chapter authorizes a designation and code of conduct for a business corporation to offer entrepreneurs and investors the option to build and invest in businesses that operate in a socially and environmentally sustainable manner. Enforcement of those responsibilities comes not from governmental oversight, but rather from new provisions on transparency and accountability included in this chapter. [L 2011, c 209, pt of ยง1]
