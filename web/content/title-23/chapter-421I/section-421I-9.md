When all reasonable efforts for mediation have been made and the dispute is not settled either in conference between the parties or through mediation, the dispute shall be submitted to arbitration in the same manner and subject to the same requirements, to the extent practicable, which now apply to condominium property regimes under part VII of chapter 514A or section 514B-162\.
