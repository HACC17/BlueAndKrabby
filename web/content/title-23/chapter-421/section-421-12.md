**ยง421-12 General and special meetings; how called.** Within thirty days after the incorporation of an association the members thereof shall hold an organization meeting at a time and place fixed by the temporary board of directors. Not less than ten days' written notice thereof shall be given to each member. An association may provide in its bylaws for one or more regular meetings each year, which may be held within the State at the time and place designated in the bylaws. Special meetings of the members may be called by the board of directors, and it shall be their duty to call the meetings when ten per cent of the members file with the secretary a petition demanding a special meeting and specifying the business to be considered at the meeting. Notice of all meetings, except as otherwise provided by law or the articles or bylaws, shall be mailed to each member at least ten days prior to the meeting, and in case of special meetings the notice shall state the purposes for which it is called, but the bylaws may require that all notices, except of proposed amendments to the articles shall be given by publication, in a periodical published by or for the association, to which substantially all its members are subscribers, or in a newspaper or newspapers whose combined circulation is general in the State in which the association operates.
