**[ยง425-169] Revocation if instrument dishonored.** The director may revoke the filing of a document filed under this subpart if the director determines that the filing fee for the document was paid by an instrument that was dishonored when presented by the State for payment. Documents revoked under this section shall be returned and notice of revocation shall be given to the filing party by regular mail. Failure to give or receive the notice shall not invalidate revocation under this section. Revocation of a filing under this section shall not affect an earlier filing. [L 2000, c 218, pt of ยง1]
