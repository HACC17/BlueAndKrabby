**ยง425-142 Statement of dissolution.** (a) After dissolution, a partner who has not wrongfully dissociated may file a statement of dissolution stating the name of the partnership and that the partnership has dissolved and is winding up its business.

(b) A statement of dissolution cancels a filed registration for the purposes of section 425-114(a) and is a limitation on authority for the purposes of section 425-114(b).

(c) For the purposes of sections 425-112 and 425-141, a person not a partner is deemed to have notice of the dissolution and the limitation on the partners' authority as a result of the statement of dissolution ninety days after it is filed.

(d) After filing and, if appropriate, recording a statement of dissolution, a dissolved partnership may file and, if appropriate, record a registration statement which will operate with respect to a person not a partner as provided in section 425-114(a) and (b) in any transaction, whether or not the transaction is appropriate for winding up the partnership business.
