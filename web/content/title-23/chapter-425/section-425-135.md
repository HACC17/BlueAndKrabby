**ยง425-135 Dissociated partner's liability to other persons.** (a) A partner's dissociation does not of itself discharge the partner's liability for a partnership obligation incurred before dissociation. A dissociated partner is not liable for a partnership obligation incurred after dissociation, except as otherwise provided in subsection (b).

(b) A partner who dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business is liable as a partner to the other party in a transaction entered into by the partnership within two years after the partner's dissociation, only if the partner is liable for the obligation under section 425-117 and at the time of entering into the transaction the other party:

(1) Reasonably believed that the dissociated partner was then a partner;

(2) Did not have notice of the partner's dissociation; and

(3) Is not deemed to have had knowledge under section 425-114(b) or notice under section 425-136(c).

(c) By agreement with the partnership creditor and the partners continuing the business, a dissociated partner may be released from liability for a partnership obligation.

(d) A dissociated partner is released from liability for a partnership obligation if a partnership creditor, with notice of the partner's dissociation but without the partner's consent, agrees to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of a partnership obligation.
