**ยง425-114 Partnership registration statement.** (a) A filed registration statement supplements the authority of a partner to enter into transactions on behalf of the partnership as follows:

(1) Except for transfers of real property, a grant of authority contained in a filed registration statement is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a limitation on that authority is not then contained in the filed registration statement. A filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.

(2) A grant of authority to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership contained in a certified copy of a filed registration statement recorded in the office for recording transfers of that real property is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a certified copy of a filed statement containing a limitation on that authority is not then of record in the office for recording transfers of that real property. The recording in the bureau of conveyances of a certified copy of a filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.

(b) A person not a partner is deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership if a certified copy of the filed registration statement containing the limitation on authority is of record in the bureau of conveyances.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (a) and (b) and sections 425-136 and 425-142, a person not a partner is not deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner merely because the limitation is contained in a filed registration statement. [L 1999, c 284, pt of ยง1]
