**ยง425-105 Recording and notification of statements.** (a) A certified copy of a statement that has been filed in the office of the director and recorded in the bureau of conveyances has the effect provided for recorded statements in this part. A recorded statement that is not a certified copy of a statement filed in the office of the director does not have the effect provided for recorded statements in this part.

(b) A person who files a statement pursuant to this section shall promptly send a copy of the statement to every nonfiling partner and to any other person named as a partner in the statement. Failure to send a copy of a statement to a partner or other person does not limit the effectiveness of the statement as to a person not a partner. [L 1999, c 284, pt of ยง1]
