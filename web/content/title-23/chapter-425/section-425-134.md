**ยง425-134 Dissociated partner's power to bind and liability to partnership.** (a) For two years after a partner dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business, the partnership is bound by an act of the dissociated partner which would have bound the partnership under section 425-112 before dissociation only if at the time of entering into the transaction the other party:

(1) Reasonably believed that the dissociated partner was then a partner;

(2) Did not have notice of the partner's dissociation; and

(3) Is not deemed to have had knowledge under section 425-114(b) or notice under section 425-136(c).

(b) A dissociated partner is liable to the partnership for any damage caused to the partnership arising from an obligation incurred by the dissociated partner after dissociation for which the partnership is liable under subsection (a). [L 1999, c 284, pt of ยง1]
