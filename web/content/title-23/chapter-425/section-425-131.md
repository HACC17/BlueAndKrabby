(b) A partner's dissociation is wrongful only if:

(1) It is in breach of an express provision of the partnership agreement; or

(2) In the case of a partnership for a definite term or particular undertaking, before the expiration of the term or the completion of the undertaking:

(A) The partner withdraws by express will, unless the withdrawal follows within ninety days after another partner's dissociation by death or otherwise under section 425-130(6) to (10) or wrongful dissociation under this subsection;

(B) The partner is expelled by judicial determination under section 425-130(5);
