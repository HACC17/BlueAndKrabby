Case Notes

Partnership did not exist as a matter of law where plaintiff and defendant did not have an agreement to share profits; a $1.5 million release fee was interest on a loan and the loan commitment and accompanying letter did not evince an intent by the parties to share profits inasmuch as they lacked any language commonly utilized in partnership agreements, such as "partnership", "partner", "profits", and did not intimate any community of interest, or co-ownership, or sharing of profits, tending to show the relationship of partners. 111 H. 286, 141 P.3d 459 (2006).
