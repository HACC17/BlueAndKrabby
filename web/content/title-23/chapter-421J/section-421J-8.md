**[ยง421J-8] Membership list.** The association shall use good faith efforts to keep an accurate and current list of the names and addresses of association members. If the list is not provided directly to members, the association shall develop a reasonable procedure by which owners may solicit votes or proxies or provide information to other owners with respect to association matters. The board may require members to furnish the association with an affidavit stating that the use of the list is requested in good faith for the protection of the association, its members, or both.
