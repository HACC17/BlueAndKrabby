"Common area" means real property within a planned community which is owned or leased by the association or is otherwise available for the use of its members or designated as common area in or pursuant to the declaration.

"Declaration" means any recorded association document, however denominated, that imposes obligations on the owners of the units with respect to maintenance or operational responsibilities for the common area, architectural control, maintenance of units, or restrictions on the use of units. A declaration includes any amendment or supplement to the instruments described in this definition.

"Member" means the person or persons owning a unit or having the right of occupancy of a unit under a recorded lease having a term of twenty or more years from its commencement date; or anyone included in the definition of a member under the association documents, including the developer, whether or not the developer owns a unit.

"Person" means an individual, firm, corporation, partnership, association, trust or other legal entity, or any combination thereof.

"Planned community" means one of the following:

(1) Real property, other than a condominium or a cooperative housing corporation or a time share plan, that is subject to a planned community association as defined under section 607-14; or

(2) A common interest community, other than a condominium or a cooperative housing corporation or a time share plan, which includes all of the following characteristics:

Case Notes

Where charter was not recorded, and because homeowner association's first amended declaration could not reasonably be interpreted as creating the requisite authority in the association to impose a mandatory payment of money for maintenance or services, the association was not an "association" under the plain meaning of this section; thus, association was not entitled to fees and costs pursuant to §421J-10\. 114 H. 361, 162 P.3d 1277 (2007).

Where homeowners' association did not qualify as an association because it was not granted authority in a declaration satisfying the statutory definition of "association" in this section, trial court erred in awarding attorney's fees and costs pursuant to §421J-10\. 112 H. 356 (App.), 145 P.3d 899 (2006).
