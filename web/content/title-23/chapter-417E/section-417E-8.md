**ยง417E-8 Injunctions.** Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any person, including a controlling person of an offeror or target company, has engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of this chapter or any rule or order hereunder, the commissioner is authorized to:

(1) Issue and cause to be served upon any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter an order requiring the person guilty thereof to cease and desist therefrom; and

(2) Bring an action in the appropriate circuit court to enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order hereunder, or refer the matter to the attorney general.

Upon a proper showing, the court may grant a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order and may order rescission of any sales or purchases of securities determined to be unlawful under this chapter or any rule or order hereunder. The court may not require the commissioner to post a bond. [L 1985, c 32, pt of ยง2]
