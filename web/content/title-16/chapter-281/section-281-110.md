Any person who has knowingly engaged in, aided, assisted, or abetted the manufacture, obtaining, keeping, or sale of such liquor contrary to law, or has been privy thereto, or has knowingly permitted the use of any place, building, premises, or conveyance for such unlawful purpose, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and be punished as provided in section 281-102\.
