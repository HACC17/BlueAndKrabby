Note

Under Article VIII, Section 2, of the State Constitution, charter provisions relating to a county's executive, legislative and administrative structure and organization are superior to statutory provisions. And under [HRS ยง50-10](/title-6/chapter-50/section-50-10/), charter provisions supersede all laws affecting the organization and government of the county which are in conflict therewith. Accordingly, the charters should be consulted to determine whether any of the provisions set out in this chapter have been superseded in whole or in part.

Case Notes

Liquor commission may adopt administrative rules to prevent racial discrimination. 69 H. 238, 738 P.2d 1205.

Defendants' motion to dismiss complaint granted insofar as it asserted claims against the liquor commission; the commission lacked the capacity to be sued. 681 F. Supp. 2d 1209 (2009).

Plaintiff must exhaust its administrative remedy in the circuit court before it may pursue its state law claims, as required by ยง281-17; thus, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's state law claims under the state constitution, this chapter, and the liquor commission rules, granted. 681 F. Supp. 2d 1209 (2009).
