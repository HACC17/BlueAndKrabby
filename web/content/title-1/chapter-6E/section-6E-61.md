**[PART IV. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS]**

**[ยง6E-61] Biological survey; designation.** A Hawaii biological survey is established and designated as a program of the State of Hawaii museum of natural and cultural history. The survey shall consist of an ongoing natural history inventory of the Hawaiian archipelago to locate, identify, evaluate, and maintain the reference collections of all native and non-native species of flora and fauna within the State for a wide range of uses. The survey shall coordinate with and complement the work of the Hawaii heritage program, established by chapter 195, which manages data on rare native plants, animals, and natural communities throughout the State. To expand the use, control, and knowledge of biological species, the survey shall also be conducted in coordination with the existing databases of the department of agriculture, the department of land and natural resources, the University of Hawaii, and other appropriate organizations.
