**§1-8 No revivor on repeal; exception.** The repeal of any law shall not revive any other law which has been repealed, unless it is clearly expressed. [CC 1859, pt of §20; RL 1925, §22; RL 1935, §24; RL 1945, §24; RL 1955, §1-11; HRS §1-8]

Case Notes

Statute repealing 1870 divorce law without expressly reenacting previous statutes on the subject would result in there being no law to enable divorces to be granted, if the repealing statute were valid. 3 H. 661.

No revival under this section where statutes attempted to be revived referred to only in general terms. 7 H. 359.
