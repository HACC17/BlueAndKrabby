Case Notes

Administrative rules pertaining to entrance into the Kahoolawe island reserve did not: (1) abridge defendants' constitutional right to engage in traditional and customary Hawaiian practices; or (2) unconstitutionally burden defendants' right to practice their religion. 132 H. 36, 319 P.3d 1044 (2014).

Complaints filed by the State against defendants for the offense of entrance into the Kahoolawe island reserve dismissed without prejudice because the complaints did not allege the requisite state of mind of intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. 132 H. 36, 319 P.3d 1044 (2014).

Where the defendants' purpose was to claim and manage, control, and subsequently occupy Kahoolawe, the defendants' intent to communicate through their presence on Kahoolawe could not be deemed "speech" for purposes of the First Amendment freedom of speech protections. 132 H. 36, 319 P.3d 1044 (2014).
