**[****ยง8-17] Caregiver Recognition Day**. The first Saturday of November shall be known and designated as "Caregiver Recognition Day", in recognition of the very significant role that caregivers play in support of Hawaii's elderly and persons with disabilities. This day is not and shall not be construed as a state holiday.

As used in this section, "caregiver" means any person who has undertaken the care, custody, or physical assistance of an elderly or disabled person, including but not limited to compensated or uncompensated family members or other relatives, or any person who has the desire, or a legal, or contractual duty to care for the health, safety, and welfare of an elderly or disabled person, including owners, operators, employees, or staff of long-term care facilities and community home-based institutions.
