(1) No such number shall constitute a part of the contract evidenced by the particular bonds upon which it is imprinted; and

(2) No liability shall attach to the board or any officer or agent thereof or the State or any officer thereof, including any fiscal agent, paying agent, or registrar for such bonds, by reason of such numbers or any use made thereof, including any use thereof made by the board, the State, any such officer or any such agent, or by reason of any inaccuracy, error, or omission with respect thereto or in such use.

The board in its discretion may require that all cost of obtaining and imprinting such numbers shall be paid by the purchaser of such bonds. For the purposes of this section, the term "CUSIP identification numbers" means the numbering system adopted by the Committee for Uniform Security Identification Procedures formed by the Securities Industry Association.
