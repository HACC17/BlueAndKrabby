(1) Any cesspool or leach field that is otherwise legal and existing on June 28, 2002 shall continue to be lawful as a nonconforming use or facility;

(2) The nonconforming use or facility shall not be expanded or reconstructed; and

(3) New septic systems may be installed in proximity to caves; provided they use solid tanks and surface leach fields so as not to permit sewage to flow into the cave and otherwise conform to existing laws and regulations.

(b) It shall be unlawful to intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly burn within a cave or cave entrance any material that produces any smoke, engine exhaust, or gas substantially harmful to any naturally occurring organisms in any cave; provided that this shall not apply to caves encountered within the normal course of a construction context.
