**ยง23G-16 Publication of replacement volumes.** The revisor of statutes may replace and bring up to date the permanent volumes of the revised laws. The revisor of statutes shall incorporate in the replacement volumes all laws enacted by the legislature since the volumes to be replaced were brought up to date. The replacement volumes shall be edited, made up, printed and bound to correspond as nearly as practicable with the present permanent volumes.

The replacement volumes shall be kept up to date by cumulative supplements. [L Sp 1977 1st, c 8, pt of ยง1]
