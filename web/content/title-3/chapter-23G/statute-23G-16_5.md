**ยง23G-16.5 Printing of acts to be included in publications.** Whenever, in any act, statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and new material is underscored as a matter of bill drafting style, the revisor, in printing the act in any publication except the Session Laws of Hawaii, need not include the brackets, the bracketed material, or the underscoring. In printing the Session Laws of Hawaii, the revisor shall include the brackets, the bracketed material, and the underscoring, except when the underscoring indicates the addition of a new section of law or when the bracketed material indicates the repeal of a section of law in which case the underscoring and the bracketed material may be omitted. [L 1978, c 80, ยง1; am L 1982, c 7, ยง1]
