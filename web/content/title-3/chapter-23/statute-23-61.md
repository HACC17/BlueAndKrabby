**[PART V.] LEGISLATIVE ADVISORY COMMITTEE**

**[ยง23-61] Purpose.** The legislature finds that the assistance of experts in a variety of fields ranging from science, finance, economics, business, technology, and other technical areas is vital to sound legislative decisionmaking. Assessment of facts and data, including a clear formulation of ideas and objectives are often needed by legislators. The purpose of this part is to provide the legislature with the necessary resource experts to aid legislators in making judicious decisions. [L 1989, c 165, pt of ยง2]
