**§23-10 Penalty for violation and false evidence.** Any person summoned or subpoenaed as provided in section 23-5 to give testimony or to produce any accounts, books, records, files, papers, documents, or other evidence relating to any matter under inquiry, who wilfully makes default, or who, having appeared, refuses to answer any question pertaining to the matter under inquiry, shall be fined not less than $100 nor more than $1,000, or imprisoned not less than one month nor more than twelve months, or both. If any person, in the course of the person's examination before the auditor, wilfully gives false evidence, the person so offending shall incur the same penalties as are or may be provided against persons convicted of perjury.
