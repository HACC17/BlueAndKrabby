**ยง21-13 Interested persons.** (a) Any person whose name is mentioned or who is otherwise identified during a hearing of an investigating committee and who, in the opinion of the committee, may be adversely affected thereby, may, upon the person's request or upon the request of any member of the committee, appear personally before the committee and testify in the person's own behalf, or, with the committee's consent, file a sworn written statement of facts or other documentary evidence for incorporation into the record of the hearing.

(b) Upon the consent of a majority of its members, an investigating committee may permit any other person to appear and testify at a hearing or submit a sworn written statement of facts or other documentary evidence for incorporation into the record thereof. No request to appear, appearance, or submission of evidence shall limit in any way the investigating committee's power of subpoena.

(c) Any person who appears before an investigating committee pursuant to this section shall have all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of a witness provided by this chapter. [L 1969, c 211, pt of ยง1; gen ch 1985]
