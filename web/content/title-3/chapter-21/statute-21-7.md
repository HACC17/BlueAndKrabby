**ยง21-7 Hearings.** (a) An investigating committee may hold hearings appropriate for the performance of its duties, at such times and places as the committee determines.

(b) The committee shall provide by its rules that each member of the committee be given at least three days written notice of any hearing to be held when the legislature is in session and at least seven days written notice of any hearing to be held when the legislature is not in session. The notices shall include a statement of the subject matter of the hearing. A hearing, and any action taken at a hearing, shall not be deemed invalid solely because notice of the hearing was not given in accordance with this requirement.

(c) Any investigating committee shall not conduct a hearing unless a quorum is present. [L 1969, c 211, pt of ยง1]
