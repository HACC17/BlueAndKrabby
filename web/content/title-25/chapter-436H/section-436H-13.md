**[****§436H****-13] Registration indicates permission to engage in the practice of athletic training.** A current registration granted under this chapter shall mean that the registered person has met requirements that include minimum practice standards to provide protection to the public and is permitted to use the title of athletic trainer and to engage in the practice of athletic training, subject to any applicable registration restrictions or conditions. In the granting of permission to engage in the practice of athletic training, and consistent with the intent of chapter 436B, the definition of "license" under section 436B-2 is inclusive of a registration issued under this chapter; therefore, an athletic trainer who is registered under this chapter shall be regarded as an athletic trainer who holds a license to practice the profession of athletic training. [L 2012, c 198, pt of §2]
