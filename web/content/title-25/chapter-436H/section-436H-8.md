**[****ยง436H****-8] Requirements to maintain registration.** (a) An athletic trainer shall have and maintain current and active status certification from the Board of Certification, Inc., as a condition of registration. Failure, refusal, or neglect of any registrant to maintain in full force and effect, a current and active status certification shall cause the automatic forfeiture of the registration of the athletic trainer, effective as of the date of the change of the registrant's certification status.

(b) The department shall not restore the forfeited license until satisfactory proof of the active status of the certification is submitted to the department. The department may assess a fee not to exceed $1,000 or restrict or place conditions on the registration as a condition of a restoration of a forfeited registration.

(c) The registrant may, within sixty days after receipt of the notification of the forfeiture, request an administrative hearing to review the forfeiture pursuant to chapter 91\. [L 2012, c 198, pt of ยง2]
