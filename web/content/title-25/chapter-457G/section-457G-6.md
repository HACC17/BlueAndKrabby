**[ยง457G-6] Biennial renewal; failure to renew; restoration, inactive license; conversion from registration.** (a) The biennial renewal fee shall be paid to the department on or before December 31 of each even-numbered year. Failure, neglect, or refusal of any licensee to pay the biennial renewal fee on or before this date shall constitute a forfeiture of the license. A forfeited license may be restored upon written application within one year from the date of forfeiture and the payment of the delinquent fee plus an amount equal to fifty per cent of the delinquent fee.

(b) Upon written application by the licensee, the director may place the licensee's active license on inactive status. During the inactive period, a licensee shall not engage in the practice of occupational therapy. The license may be reactivated at any time by the licensee by submitting a written application to the director and payment of the renewal and any other applicable fees. A licensee's inactive status shall not deprive the director of the director's authority to institute or continue any disciplinary or enforcement action against the licensee.

(c) Effective with the December 31, 2014, renewal period, each active occupational therapist registration shall be converted to an active occupational therapist license by operation of law. The conversion from registration to licensure shall not:

(1) Affect any prior discipline, limitation, or condition imposed by the director on an occupational therapist's registration;

(2) Limit the director's authority over any registrant; or

(3) Affect any pending investigation or administrative proceeding.

(d) Effective January 1, 2015, the director shall treat any application pending for an occupational therapist registration as an application for licensure, and the application shall be subject to the requirements established by the director in accordance with this chapter. [L 2014, c 209, pt of ยง2]
