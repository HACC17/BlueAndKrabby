(1) As required by law;

(2) To prevent a clear and immediate danger to a person or persons;

(3) In the course of a civil, criminal, or disciplinary action arising from the therapy where the therapist is a defendant;

(4) In a criminal proceeding where the client is a defendant and the use of the privilege would violate the defendant's right to a compulsory process of the right to present testimony and witnesses in the defendant's own behalf;

(5) In accordance with the terms of a client's previously written waiver of the privilege; or

(6) Where more than one person in a family jointly receives therapy and each family member who is legally competent executes a written waiver; in that instance, a therapist may disclose information received from any family member in accordance with the terms of the person's waiver.
