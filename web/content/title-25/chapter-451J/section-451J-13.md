**[ยง451J-13] Therapist prohibited from testifying in alimony and divorce actions.** If both parties to a marriage have obtained marriage and family therapy by a licensed marriage and family therapist, the therapist shall be prohibited from testifying in an alimony or divorce action concerning information acquired in the course of therapy. This section shall not apply to custody actions whether or not part of a divorce proceeding. [L 1998, c 159, pt of ยง2]

Case Notes

Where therapist's testimony pertained solely to the custody part of the divorce case, the prohibition against a therapist's testimony under this section did not apply. 112 H. 437 (App.), 146 P.3d 597 (2006).
