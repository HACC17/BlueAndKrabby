**§439-15 License, fees.** (a) The board shall issue a license as a beauty operator, or instructor, as the case may be, to each person who passes the required examination, pays the proper fees, and meets all of the other requirements of this chapter. The license shall state specifically the licensure category for which the person is licensed and shall be signed by the chairperson and executive secretary and impressed with the seal of the board.

(b) All licenses issued by the board shall expire on December 31 of each odd-numbered year.

(c) Every licensed beauty operator and instructor shall pay to the board by December 31 of each odd-numbered year a biennial renewal fee. The payment of the renewal fee shall entitle the licensee to renewal of the license.

(d) Failure or refusal to renew the license by December 31 of each odd-numbered year shall constitute a forfeiture of the license. The license shall be restored upon payment of all delinquent fees and a penalty fee if application is made within three years after lapse; provided that the board may consider restoration beyond this period as prescribed by rules of the board.
