**ยง457B-7 Subpoenas.** The director may issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence or the production of any books, papers, or records. If any person subpoenaed as a witness fails or refuses to respond thereto, or refuses to answer questions material to the matter pending before the department propounded by an examiner, any circuit judge, upon application of the department or any examiner thereof, may enforce by proper proceeding the attendance and testimony of the witnesses. If any person wilfully testifies falsely under oath before the department or wilfully makes a false affidavit in any proceeding before the department, the person shall be charged for perjury and shall be subject to the penalties for perjury provided by law. [L 1970, c 63, pt of ยง1; am L 1997, c 235, ยง8]
