(8) _[Paragraph effective until December 31, 2016\. For paragraph effective January 1, 2017, see below.]_ A radiologist duly licensed to practice medicine and radiology services in another state who uses telehealth while located in this State to provide radiology services to a patient who is located in the state in which the radiologist is licensed.

Standard telephone contacts, facsimile transmissions, or e-mail texts, in combination or by themselves, do not constitute a telehealth service for the purposes of this paragraph.
