**[ยง436B-14]** **Restoration of forfeited license.** A license which has been forfeited may be restored by the licensing authority within one year after the date of forfeiture upon compliance with the licensing renewal requirements provided by law and upon written application and payment of all applicable renewal fees, penalty fees, compliance resolution fund fees and, if applicable, recovery fund assessments. Any person who fails to have the person's license restored within one year from the date of forfeiture may be required by the licensing authority to reapply for licensure as a new applicant.
