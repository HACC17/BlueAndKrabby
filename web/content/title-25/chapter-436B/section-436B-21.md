**ยง436B-21** **Revoked license.** A person may apply for a new license after five years from the effective date of the revocation of the license by filing an application and complying with all current requirements for new applicants. The licensing authority may waive any applicable education or examination requirements upon being satisfied that the applicant whose license has been previously revoked, has submitted documentation that the applicant has maintained equivalent knowledge, competence, and qualifications through work experience, training, or education.
