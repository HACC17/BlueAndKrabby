(b) A licensing authority may delegate to the executive secretary, or other designee, any of its powers or duties as it deems reasonable and proper. The delegation of powers and duties by the licensing authority shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 436B-6(c). However, the licensing authority shall not delegate its discretionary functions resulting in a final decision, including but not limited to the following:

(1) Adopting, amending, or repealing rules;

(2) Ordering disciplinary action against a licensee, including the revocation, suspension, or imposition of conditions or fines; provided that summary suspensions may be delegated; and
