**[ยง468E-17] Severability provision.** If any part of this chapter is for any reason held unconstitutional, inoperative, or void, such holding of invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions of the chapter; and it shall be construed to have been the legislative intent to pass this chapter without such unconstitutional, invalid, or inoperative part therein; and the remainder of this chapter, after the exclusion of such part or parts, shall be valid as if such parts were not contained therein. [L 1974, c 48, pt of ยง1]
