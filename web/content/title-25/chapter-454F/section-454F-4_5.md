**§454F-4.5 Automatic secondary review of license application.** (a)  For each application that was determined on initial review to fail to meet the criteria for licensure, the commissioner shall provide a secondary level of review of the application which shall include the:

(1) Overall character and fitness of the applicant, taking into account all relevant circumstances and weighing all mitigating factors appropriately; and

(2) Assurance that non-discretionary licensing criteria have been applied correctly.

(b)  The commissioner may request that an applicant provide any additional or supplemental information that the commissioner deems necessary for a secondary review of an application. [L 2010, c 84, pt of §3; am L 2011, c 194, §6]
