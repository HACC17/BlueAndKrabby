**ยง437-27.5 Requirements to maintain license.** A broker shall have and maintain in full force and effect a bond as required under section 437-18\. Failure, refusal, or neglect to maintain in full force and effect a bond shall cause the automatic suspension of the license effective as of the date of expiration or cancellation of the bond. The license shall not be reinstated until a bond as required under section 437-18 is received by the board.

Failure to effect a reinstatement of a suspended license within sixty days of the suspension shall cause the license and all fees to be forfeited.

A licensee may, within fifteen calendar days after receipt of notification of the license forfeiture, request an administrative hearing pursuant to chapter 91 to review the forfeiture. [L 1985, c 102, ยง3; am L 1989, c 299, ยง3; am L 1992, c 153, ยง6]
