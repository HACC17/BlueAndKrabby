**[ยง468L-28] Audit of charter tour operators.** (a) The department may audit the records of any charter tour operator with respect to its funds. For that purpose, the department shall have free access to the office and places of business of the charter tour operator. Notwithstanding section 468L-3(6), the department may contract with a private consultant to audit the records of any charter tour operator, the cost of which shall be borne by the charter tour operator regardless of whether a violation of this chapter is established.

(b) The director, upon notice and hearing pursuant to chapter 91, may temporarily suspend or may revoke the registration as a travel agency of any charter tour operator who fails to cooperate with the department in any examination or audit of the charter tour operator conducted or contracted for by the director.
