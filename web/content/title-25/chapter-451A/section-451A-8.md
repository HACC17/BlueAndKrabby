**ยง451A-8 Biennial renewal of license; fees; effect of failure to renew.** Each person who engages in the fitting and sale of hearing aids, on or before December 31 of each odd-numbered year, shall pay to the department a biennial fee for renewal of the license and shall keep the certificate conspicuously posted in the licensee's office or place of business at all times. Where more than one office is operated by the licensee, duplicate certificates shall be issued by the department for posting at each location. A thirty-day grace period shall be allowed after December 31, during which time licenses may be renewed upon payment of a restoration fee to the department. After expiration of the grace period, the department may renew the certificates upon payment of a second restoration fee to the department. No person who applies for renewal, whose license has expired, shall be required to submit to any examination as a condition to renewal; provided that the renewal application is made within two years from the date of expiration.
