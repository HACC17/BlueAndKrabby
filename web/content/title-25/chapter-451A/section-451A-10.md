**ยง451A-10** **License by endorsement.** Whenever the director determines that another state or jurisdiction has a program with requirements equivalent to or higher than those in effect under this chapter to fit and sell hearing aids, the director may issue licenses by endorsement to applicants who hold current, unsuspended, and unrevoked certificates or licenses to fit and sell hearing aids in another state or jurisdiction. Applicants for licenses by endorsement shall not be required to pass an examination as provided in section 451A-2\. The holder of a license by endorsement shall be subject to the same provisions applying to a licensee regarding registration, fees, and grounds for renewal, suspension, and revocation of a license.
