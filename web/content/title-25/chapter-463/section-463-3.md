**§463-3 Policy; powers and duties.** It is the policy of this State to protect the general public from unlawful and unethical conduct and operation of the business of private detectives and guards. In addition to any other powers and duties authorized by law, the board may adopt, amend, or repeal rules, which shall have the force and effect of law, relating to qualifications for licensing of private detectives and guards, to the conduct and operation of the businesses of such license, and to the denial, renewal, reactivation, revocation, or suspension for cause of such licenses. The board shall consult with appropriate state and federal agencies and any appropriate industry or trade organization in establishing those rules. The rules so established shall be on the basis of what the board deems best suited to the public interest. The board also shall examine applicants for private detective or guard licenses, grant licenses, and revoke or suspend licenses of licensees who violate this chapter.
