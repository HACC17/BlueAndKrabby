**§469-4 Registration of apprentices.** Any person at least eighteen years of age, of good moral character, may qualify as an apprentice under a regularly licensed embalmer. The person shall register with the department of health, and, upon the payment of a fee, a certificate of apprenticeship shall be issued the person.

On or between July 1 and 10 of each year, the person shall renew the person's certificate of registration and pay a renewal fee. If the renewal fee is not paid within thirty days from the date due, a penalty fee for delinquency attaches and becomes a part of the total fee due the department of health for such renewal. The applicant shall also file an affidavit of three citizens who have known the applicant during the past two years, certifying to the applicant's moral character.
