**§437B-23.5 Apprentices and helpers.** It shall be unlawful for any motor vehicle mechanic apprentice/trainee or motor vehicle mechanic helper to assist a motor vehicle repair dealer or motor vehicle mechanic unless the apprentice or helper works under the direct supervision of a licensed or certified motor vehicle repair dealer or motor vehicle mechanic. All motor vehicle mechanic apprentices/trainees and motor vehicle helpers shall be assigned to and shall be the responsibility of a licensed or certified motor vehicle mechanic, provided that each licensed or certified mechanic shall have assigned to the mechanic not more than a total of five apprentices/trainees or helpers. In the event that a motor vehicle mechanic, who is assigned one or more motor vehicle mechanic apprentices/trainees or motor vehicle helpers, is terminated from employment, the motor vehicle repair dealer shall have thirty days to replace the motor vehicle mechanic in order to reassign the apprentices/trainees or helpers.
