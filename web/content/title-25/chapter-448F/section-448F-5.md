**[ยง448F-5]** **Examination, fees required.** (a) No license shall be issued unless the applicant takes an examination as prescribed by the director and receives a passing score. No license shall be issued unless all fees required by the director have been paid.

(b) The department may contract with a professional testing service to prepare, administer, and grade the examination for licensure as an electrologist. For these purposes, the department may require applicants to pay the examination fee directly to the testing service. [L 1990, c 285, pt of ยง1]
