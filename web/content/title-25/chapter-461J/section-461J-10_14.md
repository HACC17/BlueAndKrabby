**[ยง461J-10.14]** **Exemption from continuing competence requirements.** (a) Prior to the expiration of a renewal period, a licensee may submit a written request to the board for an exemption from the continuing competence requirements in this chapter.

(b) The request for an exemption shall include the following information:

(1) Evidence that, during the two-year period prior to the expiration of the license, the licensee was residing in another country for one year or longer, reasonably preventing completion of the continuing competence requirements;

(2) Evidence that, during the two-year period prior to the expiration of the license, the licensee was ill or disabled for one year or longer as documented by a licensed physician, surgeon, or clinical psychologist, preventing completion of the continuing competence requirements; or

(3) Evidence that, during the two-year period prior to the expiration of the license, a dependent family member of the licensee was ill or disabled for one year or longer as documented by a licensed physician, surgeon, or clinical psychologist, preventing completion of the continuing competence requirements.

(c) The above exemptions shall not be granted for more than one renewal period. In the event a licensee cannot complete the continuing competence requirements during the two-year period after receiving an exemption, the licensee may only renew the license on an inactive status.
