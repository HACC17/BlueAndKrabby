Case Notes

Defendant's motion to dismiss denied; because it was feasible that plaintiff's actions constituted that of a "professional engineer acting solely in [its] professional capacity", it was not apparent that [this chapter] barred plaintiff from bringing lawsuit. 216 F. Supp. 2d 1133 (2001).

Applying the ordinary meaning of "incidental and supplemental" to subsection (c), the legislature meant to provide specialty contractors with a limited ability to perform work outside of their licensed specialty area. However, the "incidental and supplemental" work must not make up the majority of the project, and must instead be "subordinate" and in addition to licensed work "of greater importance"; thus, contractors license board's refusal to consider cost and extent of work done by petitioner when determining whether that work qualified as "incidental and supplemental" was plainly erroneous in light of the clear meaning of "incidental and supplemental" in subsection (c). 129 H. 281, 298 P.3d 1045 (2013).

Where plaintiffs had no standing, as a labor union and subcontractor, to invoke the provisions of the procurement code because they were neither contractors nor bidders for the contract in question, and neither the procurement code nor this chapter authorized the circuit court to grant the remedies plaintiffs sought, and the court was presented with no other basis for granting the requested relief, the court correctly dismissed the suit. 121 H. 182 (App.), 216 P.3d 108 (2009).
