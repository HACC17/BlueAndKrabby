**[ยง444-31] The contractors license board has standing in court.** When the contractors license board receives notice, as provided in section 444-28(a), the contractors license board may enter an appearance, file an answer, appear at the court hearing, defend the action or take whatever other action it may deem appropriate. The contractors license board or its legal representative shall be served with all pleadings in an action which may result in a recovery from the contractors recovery fund.

Settlement of any claim against the contractors recovery fund shall be made only with the unanimous agreement of the contractors license board, director of commerce and consumer affairs and attorney general that settlement is in the best interest of the contractors recovery fund.
