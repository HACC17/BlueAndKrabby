**ยง444-9 Licenses required.** No person within the purview of this chapter shall act, or assume to act, or advertise, as general engineering contractor, general building contractor, or specialty contractor without a license previously obtained under and in compliance with this chapter and the rules and regulations of the contractors license board. [L 1957, c 305, ยง1(s 8); Supp, ยง166A-8; [HRS ยง444-9](/title-25/chapter-444/section-444-9/)]

Case Notes

Pursuant to this section, a general engineering or building contractor is prohibited from doing any work that would require it to act as a specialty contractor in an area the general contractor was not licensed to operate; where project required plumbing work classified as C-37 specialty work, general contractor, which did not hold a C-37 specialty license, could not do work in that area; court thus erred in holding that project did not require work in the C-37 classification and that general contractor did not have to engage a specialty contractor holding a C-37 specialty license. 97 H. 450, 40 P.3d 73 (2002).
