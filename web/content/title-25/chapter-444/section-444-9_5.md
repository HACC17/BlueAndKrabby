**ยง444-9.5 Licensing of electrical or plumbing workers**. (a) At least half of all individuals performing electrical or plumbing work employed on a construction job site by an electrical or plumbing contractor shall be licensed in accordance with chapter 448E. The board may waive this requirement in any county when there are insufficient licensed electrical or plumbing workers in that county to comply with this section.

(b) All individuals employed on a construction job site by an electrical or plumbing contractor who are licensed in accordance with chapter 448E shall visibly display their license on their person while on the construction job site. Only individuals displaying their license at the time of a site inspection shall be counted as a licensee to determine compliance with this section.
