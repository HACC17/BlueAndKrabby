**[ยง449-1.7] Indicia of escrow depository prohibited.** Unless licensed under this chapter to engage in the business of an escrow depository, no person may use the word "escrow" or words of similar import, or translations of those words, as a facetious or fanciful name, or in a manner that might suggest or tend to lead others into believing that the person is an escrow depository.
