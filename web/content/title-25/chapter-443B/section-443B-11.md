**[ยง443B-11] Action on collection agency bond.** If a collection agency has failed to account for and pay over the proceeds of any collection made, the client shall have, in addition to all other legal remedies, a right of action in the client's own name on the bond given pursuant to this chapter and the total of all recoveries from the sureties shall not exceed the face of the bond. Upon entering judgment for plaintiff in any action on the bond required by this chapter, for more than any sum which may have been tendered in court by the defendant, the court shall include in the judgment reasonable compensation for the services of plaintiff's attorney in the action. [L 1987, c 191, pt of ยง1]
