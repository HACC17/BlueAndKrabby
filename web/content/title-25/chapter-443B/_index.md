Case Notes

Plaintiff not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim under §480-13, as plaintiff failed to establish that plaintiff was actually damaged by defendant's failure to register as a debt collector. 183 F. Supp. 2d 1234 (2002).

Designation of the director to enforce this chapter does not preclude standing to an individual to sue under chapter 480, provided the individual can satisfy the definition of "consumer"; circuit court's conclusion that plaintiffs had no standing to sue for a chapter 443B violation because director was charged with enforcement of the chapter, was error. 78 H. 213 (App.), 891 P.2d 300 (1995).

Because defendant was a bank, it was not a collection agency subject to this chapter's requirements. 901 F. Supp. 2d 1253 (2012).
