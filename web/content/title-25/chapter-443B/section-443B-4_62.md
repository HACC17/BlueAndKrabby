**[ยง443B-4.62] Audits.** (a) When the director has reasonable cause to believe that a registrant created deficiencies or other problems in accounts which hold funds or other forms of payment collected on behalf of a complainant, the director may order an audit of the account or accounts, or an unannounced verification of the account's cash balance. The audit or verification shall be conducted by a certified public accountant, public accountant, or other designee of the director.

(b) If an audit or unannounced verification of an account ordered by the director reveals deficiencies or other problems in accounts which hold client funds and other forms of payment, the cost of the audit or the verification shall be paid by the collection agency. If an audit or unannounced verification of an account ordered by the director does not reveal deficiencies and problems in accounts, the cost of the audit or unannounced verification shall be paid by the complainant. Failure of a collection agency to pay for an audit or unannounced verification within thirty days of receipt of the billing statement shall result in suspension of the agency's registration until payment is made.
