Case Notes

Although plaintiffs were "consumers" within the meaning of §§480-1 and 480-13, plaintiffs' payment of their Hawaii medical services association (HMSA) lien to the Kentucky-based company that contracted with HMSA to provide subrogation and "claims recovery services", but which had violated this section, did not constitute an injury for which plaintiffs could bring suit under §480-13(b). 117 H. 153, 177 P.3d 341 (2008).

Kentucky-based company that contracted with the Hawaii medical services association (HMSA) to provide subrogation and "claims recovery services" was a "collection agency" within the meaning of §443B-1, and subject to the registration requirements of this section, where company was collecting "claims" that HMSA had against plaintiffs--money that company alleged was "due and owing". 117 H. 153, 177 P.3d 341 (2008).
