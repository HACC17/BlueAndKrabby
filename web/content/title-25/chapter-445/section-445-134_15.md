**[ยง445-134.15] Pawnbroker's recourse.** (a) Unless found to be stolen, mortgaged, or otherwise encumbered, any pledged goods not redeemed within the last holding period may thereafter, at the option of the pawnbroker, be forfeited and become the property of the pawnbroker.

(b) Where the customer has pledged defective goods, the only recourse of a pawnbroker shall be against the pledged goods. [L 1992, c 192, pt of ยง2]
