**[ยง445-134.14]** **Redemption of pledged goods.** (a) Except as otherwise provided by this part, any person properly identified as the customer in a pawn transaction or as the assignee or agent thereof, and presenting a pawn transaction agreement to the pawnbroker, shall be presumed to be entitled to redeem the pledged goods described therein.

(b) If a pawn transaction agreement is lost, destroyed, or stolen, the customer may so notify the pawnbroker in writing, and receipt of such notice shall invalidate the pawn transaction agreement as an instrument to redeem the pledged goods, if the pledged goods have not previously been redeemed. Before delivering the pledged goods or issuing a new pawn transaction agreement, the pawnbroker may require the customer to sign a written statement or affidavit concerning the loss, destruction, or theft of the pawn transaction agreement.
