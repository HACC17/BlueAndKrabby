**[ยง460J-23.5] Subcontracting.** Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter, any individual who is licensed by the board as an operator in both the branches of general pest and termite control may subcontract for the actual performance of fumigation with an individual who is licensed by the board as an operator in the branch of fumigation.

Nothing herein contained shall permit or authorize any licensee to perform, or attempt to perform, advertise, or hold out to the public or to any person that the licensee is authorized, qualified, or licensed to perform, pest control work in any branch, or by any method, for which the licensee is not licensed.

Subcontracting of work, as permitted herein, shall not relieve the prime contractor or the subcontractor from responsibility for, or from disciplinary action because of, any act or omission on the contractor's or subcontractor's part, which would otherwise be a ground for disciplinary action. [L 1975, c 91, ยง1; gen ch 1985]
