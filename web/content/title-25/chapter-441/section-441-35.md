**ยง441-35 Perpetual care fund expressly permitted.** A perpetual care fund and all payments or contributions to it are expressly permitted as and for charitable and eleemosynary purposes. No payment, gift, grant, bequest, or other contribution for perpetual care is invalid by reason of any indefiniteness or uncertainty of the persons designated as beneficiaries in the instruments creating the fund, nor is the fund or any contribution to it invalid as violating any law against perpetuities, or the suspension of the power of alienation of title to property. [L 1967, c 199, pt of ยง1; [HRS ยง441-35](/title-25/chapter-441/section-441-35/)]
