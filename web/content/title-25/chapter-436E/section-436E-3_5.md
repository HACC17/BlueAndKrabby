Attorney General Opinions

Medical acupuncture is not sufficiently distinct from traditional acupuncture so as to fall outside the scope of the practice of acupuncture. Physicians licensed by board of medical examiners cannot practice medical acupuncture absent licensure by board of acupuncture. Att. Gen. Op. 03-5.
