**§436E-13 Use of titles.** (a) A licensee who has been awarded a license to practice acupuncture by the board in this State may use the title of "Licensed Acupuncturist" or designation "L.Ac." with the licensee's name in an advertisement for acupuncture or announce or append the designation to the licensee's name.

(b) A licensee who has been awarded an earned doctoral degree may use the designation "Ph.D." in an advertisement for acupuncture or announce or append the designation to the licensee's name if the degree was granted from a university or college recognized by a regional or national accrediting body recognized by the United States Department of Education. A Ph.D. recognized by the board under this subsection shall designate a nonpractitioner as opposed to a practitioner or "doctor" of acupuncture as provided in subsection (c).

(c) A licensee who has been approved by the board to use the doctor of acupuncture title, may use the title "Doctor of Acupuncture" or designation of "D.Ac.", after the licensee's name, or the term "Doctor" or prefix "Dr." provided that the word "Acupuncturist" immediately follows the licensee's name if the term "Doctor", or the prefix "Dr." is used alone.

(d) Before any licensee shall be eligible to use the doctor of acupuncture title, the licensee shall furnish satisfactory proof to the board that the licensee has been awarded an earned doctoral degree in acupuncture (traditional oriental medicine). For licensees who graduated from an institute, school, or college located in the United States or any territory under the jurisdiction of the United States, the institute, school, or college shall be accredited or recognized as a candidate for accreditation by a regional or national accrediting body that is recognized by the United States Department of Education for the accreditation or pre-accreditation ("candidacy") of professional post-graduate doctoral programs in acupuncture and oriental medicine. For licensees who graduated from a foreign institute, school, or college, the licensee, at the licensee's own expense, shall have the licensee's transcripts and curriculum evaluated by a board approved and designated professional evaluator who shall make a determination on whether the transcripts and curriculum are at least equivalent to the United States recognized doctoral program of study in acupuncture and oriental medicine, and that the foreign institute is licensed, approved, or accredited by the appropriate governmental authority or an agency recognized by a governmental authority in the respective foreign jurisdiction and whose curriculum is approved by the board.

(e) Except as provided in this section, use of other titles, prefixes, or designations shall not be permitted. [L 1985, c 214, pt of §1; am L 1992, c 90, §1; am L 1994, c 43, §1; am L 2013, c 36, §1]
