**§458-10 Subpoenas, oaths.** In all proceedings before the director, the director shall have the same powers respecting administering oaths, compelling the attendance of witnesses, and the production of documentary evidence, as are possessed by circuit courts. In case of disobedience by any person or persons of any order of the director or any subpoena issued by the director or of the refusal of any witness to testify to any matter regarding which the witness may be questioned lawfully, any circuit judge on application by the director shall compel obedience as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued from a circuit court or a refusal to testify therein.
