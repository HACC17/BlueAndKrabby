(c) Neither the proceedings nor the records of any peer review process shall be subject to discovery. No person involved in the peer review process shall be required to testify on that process; provided that statements made by any person in connection with the peer review process who is a party to an action or proceeding, the subject matter of which was reviewed in that process, shall be subject to discovery.
