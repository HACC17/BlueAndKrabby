**ยง457-2.7 Advanced practice registered nurse.** (a) Practice as an advanced practice registered nurse means the scope of nursing in a category approved by the board, regardless of compensation or personal profit, and includes the registered nurse scope of practice. The scope of an advanced practice registered nurse includes but is not limited to advanced assessment; telehealth; and the diagnosis, prescription, selection, and administration of therapeutic measures including over the counter drugs, legend drugs, and controlled substances within the advanced practice registered nurse's role and specialty-appropriate education and certification.

(b) The advanced practice registered nurse's scope of practice supersedes the registered nurse's scope of practice. Advanced practice registered nurses shall practice within standards established or recognized by the board and be guided by the scope of practice authorized by this chapter, the rules of the board, and nursing standards established or recognized by the board including but not limited to:

(1) The National Council of State Boards of Nursing Model Nursing Practice Act, Article II, Scope of Nursing Practice, section 4; and

(2) The National Council of State Boards of Nursing Model Nursing Administrative Rules, Chapter Two, Standards of Nursing Practice, section 2.4.1;

provided that NCSBN shall have no legal authority over the board and shall have no legal authority or powers of oversight of the board in the exercise of its powers and duties authorized by law.

(c) An advanced practice registered nurse shall comply with the requirements of this chapter; recognize limits of the advanced practice registered nurse's knowledge and experience and planning for the management of situations that exceed the scope of authorized practice; and consult with or refer clients to other health care providers, as appropriate.
