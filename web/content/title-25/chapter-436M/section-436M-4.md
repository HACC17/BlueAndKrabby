**[ยง436M-4] False alarms; reporting.** Alarm businesses that maintain, service, or monitor alarm systems shall, upon request by the police, share with them the data about false alarms and alarm systems in operation needed to determine the monthly false alarm rate for each alarm business. Data obtained from each alarm business shall be used by the police only for statistical purposes and shall not be released to others. Alarm businesses and the police shall cooperate to reduce to a minimum the number of false alarms reported to the police. [L 1986, c 134, pt of ยง1]
