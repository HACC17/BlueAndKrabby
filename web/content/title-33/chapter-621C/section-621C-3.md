**ยง621C-3 Use immunity.** The testimony or production that is compelled under the order, and any information directly or indirectly derived from the testimony or production, may not be used against the person in any manner in a criminal case, except in a prosecution for perjury, for giving a false statement, or for an offense involving a failure to comply with the order; provided that such person may be prosecuted or punished for any crime so long as testimony or production that is compelled under the order, and any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or production, is not used against such person in such prosecution. [L 1978, c 212, pt of ยง2]

Case Notes

Use immunity granted by section is inadequate to supplant the privilege against self-incrimination conferred by article I, ยง10 of the state constitution. 62 H. 269, 614 P.2d 915 (1980).
