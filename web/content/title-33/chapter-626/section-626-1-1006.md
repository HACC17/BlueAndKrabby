**Rule 1006 Summaries.** The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs which cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation. The originals, or duplicates, shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other parties at reasonable time and place. The court may order that they be produced in court. [L 1980, c 164, pt of ยง1]

RULE 1006 COMMENTARY

This rule is identical with Fed. R. Evid. 1006, the Advisory Committee's Note to which says: "The admission of summaries of voluminous books, records, or documents offers the only practicable means of making their contents available to judge and jury."
