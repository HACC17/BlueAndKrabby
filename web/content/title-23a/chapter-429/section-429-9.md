**[ยง429-9] Disposition of personal property of inactive nonprofit association.** If a nonprofit association has been inactive for three years or longer, or a different period specified in a document of the nonprofit association, a person in possession or control of personal property of the nonprofit association may transfer custody of the property:

(1) If a document of the nonprofit association specifies a person to whom transfer is to be made under those circumstances, to that person; or

(2) If no person is so specified, to a nonprofit association or nonprofit corporation pursuing broadly similar purposes or to a government, governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality. [L 1999, c 161, pt of ยง1]
