(A) Identify specific types or categories of activities that do not violate the duty of loyalty, if not manifestly unreasonable; and

(B) Specify the number or percentage of members or disinterested managers that may authorize or ratify, after full disclosure of all material facts, a specific act or transaction that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty;

(3) Unreasonably reduce the duty of care under section 428-409(c) or 428-603(b)(3);

(4) Eliminate the obligation of good faith and fair dealing under section 428-409(d), but the operating agreement may determine the standards by which the performance of the obligation is to be measured, if the standards are not manifestly unreasonable;

(5) Vary the right to expel a member in an event specified in section 428-601(5);

(6) Vary the requirement to wind up the limited liability company's business in a case specified in section 428-801(3) or 428-801(4); or
