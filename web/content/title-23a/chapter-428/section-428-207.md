**ยง428-207 Correcting filed record.** (a) A limited liability company or foreign limited liability company may correct a record filed by the director if the record contains a false or erroneous statement or was defectively certified or signed.

(b) A record is corrected:

(1) By preparing articles of correction that:

(A) Describe the record, including its filing date, or have attached a copy of it to the articles of correction;

(B) Specify the incorrect statement and the reason it is incorrect or the manner in which the certification or signing was defective; and

(C) Correct the incorrect statement or defective certification or signing; and

(2) By delivering the articles of correction to the director for filing.

(c) Articles of correction are effective retroactively to the effective date of the record they correct. However, a person who has relied on the uncorrected record and was adversely affected by the correction is not bound by the correction until the articles of correction are filed.
