(2) A misrepresentation has been made of any material matter in any application, report, affidavit, or other record or document submitted by the company pursuant to this part.

(b) The director may not revoke a certificate of authority of a foreign limited liability company unless the director sends the company notice of the revocation, at least sixty days before its effective date, by mailing the notice to the foreign limited liability company at its last known address appearing in the director's records. The notice shall identify the cause for the revocation of the certificate of authority.
