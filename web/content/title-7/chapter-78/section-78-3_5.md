**[ยง78-3.5] Experimental modernization projects.** (a) It is the intent of this section to encourage and facilitate improvements in the human resource programs of the several jurisdictions. With the approval of the chief executive, the director may conduct experimental modernization projects to determine whether specific changes in its human resource program would result in a more desirable program for the jurisdiction.

(b) Prior to the implementation of any experimental modernization project, the director shall:

(1) Develop a plan identifying the purposes of the project, the methodology to be used, the duration of the project, the criteria for evaluation of the project, and the cost of the project, if any;

(2) Consult with the employees who would be involved in the conduct of the project; and

(3) Negotiate with the exclusive representative if a modification or waiver of any provision in a collective bargaining agreement is necessary to conduct the project.

(c) While the project is in progress, it shall not be limited by state or local personnel laws and rules, but shall be in compliance with all equal employment opportunity laws and laws prohibiting discrimination. [L 2000, c 253, pt of ยง74]
