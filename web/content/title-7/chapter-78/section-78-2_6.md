**ยง78-2.6 Prospective employees; suitability for public employment.** All prospective employees, regardless of the positions they will assume, shall demonstrate their suitability for public employment by:

(1) Passing a pre-employment controlled substance drug test if required by the employing jurisdiction; and

(2) Attesting that during the three-year period immediately preceding the date of application for employment, the person was not convicted of any controlled-substance-related offense.

If an applicant fails to meet the suitability requirements of the employing jurisdiction, the applicant shall be disqualified from further employment consideration or deemed ineligible for appointment under section 76-29 on the basis of unsuitability for public employment.

Notwithstanding paragraph (2), for positions described in section 76-16(b)(13)(C), an applicant shall not be automatically disqualified from employment based on a controlled-substance-related offense, provided that reasonable safeguards are in place to protect employees and the public.
