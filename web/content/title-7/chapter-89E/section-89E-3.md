**[ยง89E-3] Special retirement benefit.** (a) Notwithstanding section 88-99 or any other law to the contrary, the employees' retirement system may provide, regardless of whether the actuarial value of the system's assets is one hundred per cent of the system's actuarial accrued liability, the benefits authorized under this section. Any employee who receives official notification that the employee's position is being abolished or who is directly affected by a reduction-in-force or workforce restructuring plan, including privatization, proposed by an agency may elect, if the employee is eligible to receive benefits from the employees' retirement system and meets any of the criteria specified in subsection (c), the special retirement benefit provided by this section in lieu of exercising any reduction-in-force rights under chapter 89 and in lieu of receiving any severance benefits under section 89E-2\. To receive the special retirement benefit offered under this section, the employee shall comply with the application and time frame requirements specified in subsection (b).

(b) Any employee who elects to retire and receive the special retirement benefit under this section shall notify the employee's employing agency and file a formal application for retirement with the employees' retirement system not less than thirty days or more than one hundred fifty days prior to the date of retirement.

(c) Notwithstanding the age and length of service requirements of sections 88-73, 88-281, and 88-331, an employee shall qualify for the special retirement benefit if, on the employee's retirement date, the employee meets any one of the following criteria:

(1) Has at least five years of credited service as a contributory class A or B member and is at least fifty years of age;

(2) Has at least twenty years of credited service as a contributory class A or B member, irrespective of age;

(3) Has at least ten years of credited service as a noncontributory class C member and is at least fifty-seven years of age;

(4) Has at least twenty-five years of credited service as a noncontributory class C member, irrespective of age;

(5) A class H member who became a member prior to July 1, 2012, has at least five years of credited service[,] and is at least fifty-seven years of age;

(6) A class H member who became a member prior to July 1, 2012, and has at least twenty-five years of credited service, irrespective of age;

(7) A class H member who became a member after June 30, 2012, has at least ten years of credited service[,] and is at least sixty years of age; or

(8) A class H member who became a member after June 30, 2012, has at least twenty-five years of credited service[,] and is at least fifty-five years of age.

(d) Any employee who exercises the option of the special retirement benefit under this section because the employee does not qualify with respect to the age and length of service requirements under section 88-73, 88-281, or 88-331, to receive a retirement benefit without penalty, shall not have the retirement benefit reduced in accordance with the actuarial formula normally used by the employees' retirement system for the calculation of early retirement benefits.

(e) The head of the agency shall transmit a list of employees who elected and received the special retirement benefit to the board of trustees of the employees' retirement system not less than thirty days but not more than one hundred fifty days prior to the employee's retirement date. The head of the agency shall certify that the employees on the list have in fact selected the special retirement benefit in lieu of receiving the severance benefit under section 89E-2 and exercising any reduction-in-force rights under chapter 89.

(f) The board of trustees of the employees' retirement system shall make payments with respect to all eligible employees who retire pursuant to this section. The board shall determine the portion of the additional actuarial present value of benefits to be charged to the State based upon retirements authorized under this section. If necessary, the State shall make additional payments to the employees' retirement system in the amounts required to amortize the additional actuarial present value of benefits over a period of five years. The unfunded actuarial present values of benefits payable under this section shall be considered part of the unfunded accrued liability of the employees' retirement system under sections 88-122 and 88-123\.
