**[ยง89E-8] Guidelines; development and administration.** [(a)] The departments of human resources development and budget and finance shall develop and administer guidelines and time frames with the exclusive representatives of affected public employees to implement the voluntary severance benefits and special retirement benefits under this chapter. The department of human resources development, the department of labor and industrial relations, the employees' retirement system, and the Hawaii employer-union health benefits trust fund shall work cooperatively to ensure that briefings are provided prior to the implementation of any workforce restructuring plan to educate the employees whose positions are being abolished or who are directly affected by a reduction-in-force or workforce restructuring plan.

[(b)] The department of human resources development and the department of budget and finance shall report to the legislature on any restructuring activities initiated as a consequence of this chapter no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session beginning with the regular session of 2017.

The report shall include a description of the abolished positions, an explanation as to how the new workforce structure, including resulting service delivery changes, will more efficiently serve the needs of the agency's clients, the cost of the benefit per participant, and the total cost to the State.
