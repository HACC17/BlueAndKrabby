**[ยง89E-2] Voluntary severance benefit.** (a) Any employee entitled to reduction-in-force rights under chapter 89 and who receives official notification that the employee's position is being abolished or who is directly affected by a reduction-in-force or workforce restructuring plan, including privatization, may elect to receive a voluntary severance benefit provided under this section in lieu of exercising any reduction-in-force rights under chapter 89 and in lieu of receiving any special retirement benefit under section 89E-3.

(b) A one-time lump sum cash bonus severance benefit shall be calculated at five per cent of the employee's base salary for every year of service worked, not to exceed ten years, and shall not exceed fifty per cent of the employee's annual base salary.

For the purposes of this section, "annual base salary" means an employee's annual salary for the position from which the employee is to be separated, excluding all other forms of compensation paid or accrued, whether a bonus, allowance, differential, or value of leave or compensatory time off credits. Compensation excluded from base salary includes shortage category differential, night shift differential, overtime, compensatory time off credits, vacation or sick leave credits, and workers' compensation benefits.

(c) A severance benefit shall be in addition to any payment owing to the employee upon separation from service, including accumulated unused vacation allowances or compensatory time credits.

(d) All severance benefits paid under this section shall be subject to applicable state income tax laws and rules.

(e) A severance benefit provided under this section shall not be considered as a part of a discharged employee's salary, service credit, or a cost item as defined in section 89-2 when calculating retirement benefits or sick and vacation leave. [L Sp 2016 2d, c 1, pt of ยง2]
