"Adjustment" means a change in wages, hours, benefits, or other term and condition of employment.

"Appropriate authority" means the governor, the respective mayors, the chief justice of the supreme court, the board of education, the board of regents, the state public charter school commission, the Hawaii health systems corporation board, the auditor, the ombudsman, and the director of the legislative reference bureau. These individuals or boards may make adjustments for their respective excluded employees.
