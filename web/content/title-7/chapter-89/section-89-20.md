**ยง89-20 Chapter inoperative, when.** (a) If any provision of this chapter jeopardizes the receipt by the State or any county of any federal grant-in-aid or other federal allotment of money, the provision shall, insofar as the fund is jeopardized, be deemed to be inoperative.

(b) The federal Pro-Children Act, as it relates to smoking at public school indoor facilities, shall preempt this chapter to the extent the federal act imposes mandatory restrictions on smoking in the workplace. [L 1970, c 171, pt of ยง2; am L 2004, c 87, ยง3]
