Case Notes

Per diem employees are included in class of part-time employees to whom agency may deny membership in the system under this section and its implementing administrative rule. Because at least portions of plaintiff's time as per diem judge fell within categories specified in the rule, agency correctly determined that plaintiff did not qualify for full-time credited service under the retirement law. 75 H. 42, 856 P.2d 1227.
