**§88-191 Computation of service.** Whenever the term of ten years is mentioned in this part, each year of the ten years shall be computed by adding together the months of service (including portions of any month, where the full month has not been served, as a full month), and dividing the months by twelve.

"Service" means service in any county, and where the proposed pensioner has service in any other county than the one by which it is proposed that he be pensioned, his service in the other county shall be added to his service in the pensioning county in order to determine his eligibility for or the amount of pension, provided his service in the police department under the sheriff, prior to the creation of the government of the city and county of Honolulu in 1905, shall be included.
