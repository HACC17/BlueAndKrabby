**§88-188 Additional conditions.** The pension systems shall further provide, subject to this part, that:

(1) If an employee becomes unable to work before the employee reaches the age of sixty after the employee has had ten or more years of service, the employee may retire, regardless of age, on a disability allowance payable for the remainder of the employee's life or until the employee is able to return to work. The allowance shall be established at nine-tenths of one-seventieth of the employee's average annual salary or compensation during the last ten years of employment by the county multiplied by the number of the employee's years of service.

(2) If an employee prior to May 17, 1937, met with an accident incurred without the employee's fault or negligence in the performance of duty in the employee's service for the county which has rendered the employee incapable of continuing the employee's work the employee may retire on a pension of sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the employee's average annual salary or compensation during the last ten years or such lesser time as the employee may have been in county employment, for life or until the employee is able to return to service.
