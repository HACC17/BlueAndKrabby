Attorney General Opinions

Power of attorney authorizing attorney to receive, endorse and collect checks does not constitute assignment of retirement allowance prohibited by section. Att. Gen. Op. 61-69.

To extent that divorce decrees create liens that act directly on retirement system funds, the decrees are unenforceable. Att. Gen. Op. 79-3.

Case Notes

Section does not prevent divorce court to order a party to maintain his former wife and children as beneficiaries under the retirement system. 52 H. 357, 477 P.2d 620.
