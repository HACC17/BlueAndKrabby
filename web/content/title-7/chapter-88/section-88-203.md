**ยง88-203 Limitation of amount.** No pension granted under section 88-201 shall exceed the annual amount of one-seventieth of the average annual salary or compensation received by the person to whom the pension is granted during the person's last ten years of the person's employment by the county, multiplied by the number of years during which the person was in the employment or service of the county prior to the person's becoming a member of the employees' retirement system. The pension granted to a person who has not attained the age of sixty years but through illness or injury sustained without the person's fault or negligence in the performance of duty in the person's service for the county has become incapable of sustained remunerative work shall be nine-tenths of the amount computed in the manner hereinabove prescribed.
