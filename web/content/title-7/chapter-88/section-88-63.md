**[ยง88-63] Credit for unused sick leave.** A public employee who retires or leaves government service in good standing with sixty days or more of unused sick leave shall be entitled to additional service credit in the retirement system as follows:

(1) An employee with sixty days of unused sick leave to the employee's credit shall have the employee's years of service increased by three months for the purpose of computing the employee's retirement allowance.

(2) For each additional twenty days or major fraction thereof of unused sick leave in excess of sixty days that the employee has to the employee's credit the employee shall have the employee's years of service increased by one month for the purpose of computing the employee's retirement allowance.

The allowance on service retirement of section 88-74 and the service benefit limitation therein shall not apply to retirement allowances which exceed such limitations by virtue of the application of this section in the computation of retirement allowances and no reduction in such retirement allowances shall be made on account of such limitations.
