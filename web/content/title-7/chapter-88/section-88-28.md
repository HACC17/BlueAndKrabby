**§88-28 Voting; rules.** Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote on the board of trustees. Five concurring votes shall be necessary for a decision by the trustees at any meeting of the board.

Subject to the limitations of this part, the board, from time to time, shall establish rules for the administration of the funds of the system and for the transaction of its business. [L 1925, c 55, §5(6), (7); RL 1935, pt of §7924; RL 1945, pt of §707; am L 1951, c 93, §3; RL 1955, §6-65; [HRS §88-28](/title-7/chapter-88/section-88-28/); am L 1969, c 110, pt of §1; am L 1993, c 349, §2]

Attorney General Opinions

An action of the board requires at least four concurring votes, and in the absence of such concurrence the action would be considered lost. Att. Gen. Op. 80-1.

Case Notes

Board's four-to-four tie vote did not constitute a "decision by the trustees"; the tie vote neither authorized nor affirmatively disavowed appeal. 87 H. 152, 952 P.2d 1215.
