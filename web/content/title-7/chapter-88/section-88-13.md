**§88-13 Bonus; retirants not eligible for.** No bonus shall be paid to any person who retires on or after July 1, 1957, and who will receive or who is receiving social security benefits when said benefits are based in whole or in part upon contributions made by the State or any of its political subdivisions. [L 1961, c 175, pt of §12; Supp, §6-252; [HRS §88-13](/title-7/chapter-88/section-88-13/); am L 1969, c 110, pt of §1]

Attorney General Opinions

Mere opportunity to secure social security benefits in the future is not ground for disqualification. Words "upon his retirement" mean "at any time during his retirement". Att. Gen. Op. 64-27.
