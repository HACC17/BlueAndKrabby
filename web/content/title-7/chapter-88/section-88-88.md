**§88-88 Adjustment of retirement allowances of retirants.** The retirement allowance of any class A member whose allowance was reduced by reason of social security coverage subsequent to December 31, 1955, shall be increased by the amount of such reduction; provided that the increase shall be limited to 1/280 of that part of the class A member's average final compensation not in excess of $4,200 per annum multiplied by the number of years of the class A member's creditable service rendered between January 1, 1956, and January 1, 1965, for which the class A member received compensation covered by social security, and provided that in the case of a member who retired on a service-connected disability retirement the increase shall be limited to 16 and 2/3 per cent of that part of the member's average final compensation not in excess of $4,200 per year.
