**[§87A-33.5] State and county contribution; reimbursement for retired employees.** Effective July 1, 2007, an employee-beneficiary who retires and relocates outside of the State shall be reimbursed for the premiums paid by the employee-beneficiary for a personal health insurance policy; provided that the board shall determine which employee-beneficiaries and what types of personal health insurance policies shall be eligible for reimbursement and may set other conditions that shall be met for the employee-beneficiary to receive the reimbursements provided under this section.

The reimbursement shall be the lesser of:

(1) The actual cost of the personal health insurance policy; or

(2) The amount of the state or county contribution for the most comparable health benefits plan.

Reimbursements shall be paid by the fund on a quarterly basis upon the presentation of documentation that the premiums for the personal health insurance policy have been paid by the employee-beneficiary. This section shall apply to all employee-beneficiaries who retire and relocate outside of the State, regardless of their date of retirement. [L 2006, c 167, §1]
