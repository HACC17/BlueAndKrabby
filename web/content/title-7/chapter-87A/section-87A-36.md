(1) An employee hired after June 30, 1996, and prior to July 1, 2001, who transfers employment after June 30, 2001, and who cumulatively accrues at least ten years of credited service; and

(2) An employee hired after June 30, 1996, and prior to July 1, 2001, who has at least ten years of credited service prior to a break in service.

For purposes of this section:

"Break in service" means to leave state or county employment for more than ninety calendar days before returning to state or county employment.

"Transfer" means to leave state or county employment and return to state or county employment within ninety calendar days.

(b) For purposes of this section, if an employee leaves state or county employment and returns to state or county employment after July 1, 2001, upon retirement, the employee's years of service shall be computed in the same manner as set forth in chapter 88.

(c) The State, through the department of budget and finance, and the counties, through their respective departments of finance, shall pay to the fund:

(1) For retired employees based on the self plan with ten or more years but fewer than fifteen years of service, a monthly contribution equal to one-half of the base medicare or non-medicare monthly contribution set forth under section 87A-33(b);

(2) For retired employees based on the self plan with at least fifteen but fewer than twenty-five years of service, a monthly contribution equal to seventy-five per cent of the base medicare or non-medicare monthly contribution set forth under section 87A-33(b);

(3) For retired employees based on the self plan with twenty-five or more years of service, a monthly contribution equal to one-hundred per cent of the base medicare or non-medicare monthly contribution set forth under section 87A-33(b); and

(4) One-half of the monthly contributions for the employee-beneficiary or employee-beneficiary with dependent-beneficiaries upon the death of the employee, as defined in paragraph (1)(E) of the definition of "employee" in section 87A-1.

If both husband and wife are employee-beneficiaries, the total contribution by the State or county shall not exceed the monthly contribution for two supplemental medicare self or non-medicare self plans, as appropriate. [L 2001, c 88, pt of §1; am L 2004, c 184, §2]
