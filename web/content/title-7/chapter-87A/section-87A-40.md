**[ยง87A-40] Employee-beneficiary contributions; health benefit plans.** (a) Each employee-beneficiary shall make a monthly contribution to the fund amounting to the difference between the monthly charge of the health benefits plan selected by the employee-beneficiary and the contribution made by the State or county for the employee-beneficiary to the fund. Nothing in this section shall prohibit any employee-beneficiary from participating in a cafeteria plan authorized under Title 26 United States Code section 125, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and section 78-30.

(b) During the period the health benefits plan selected by an employee-beneficiary is in effect, the employee-beneficiary, if allowed by law, shall authorize the employee-beneficiary's contribution to be withheld and transmitted to the fund monthly by the comptroller, employees' retirement system, or finance officer who disburses the employee-beneficiary's compensation, pension, or retirement pay. If an employee-beneficiary's contribution to the fund is not withheld and transmitted to the fund, the employee-beneficiary shall pay the monthly contribution:

(1) In the case of an employee-beneficiary who normally receives the employee-beneficiary's compensation from the comptroller or employees' retirement system, directly to the fund by the first day of each month; or

(2) In the case of all other employee-beneficiaries, to the respective finance officer from whom the employee-beneficiary normally receives compensation for transmittal to the fund by the first day of each month.

(c) Notwithstanding subsection (a), an employee-beneficiary's monthly contribution to the fund shall include the amount that would have been the employee-beneficiary's contribution if the employee-beneficiary had not elected to participate in the cafeteria plan. [L 2001, c 88, pt of ยง1]
