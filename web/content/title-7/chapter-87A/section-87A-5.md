**PART II. BOARD OF TRUSTEES**

**ยง87A-5 Composition of board.** _[See explanatory note below.]_ The board of trustees of the employer-union health benefits trust fund shall consist of ten trustees appointed by the governor in accordance with the following procedure:

(1) Five trustees, one of whom shall represent retirees, to represent employee-beneficiaries and to be selected as follows:

(A) Three trustees shall be appointed from a list of two nominees per trustee selected by each of the three exclusive representative organizations that have the largest number of employee-beneficiaries;

(B) One trustee shall be appointed from a list of two nominees selected by mutual agreement of the remaining exclusive employee representative organizations; and

(C) One trustee representing retirees shall be appointed from a list of two nominees selected by mutual agreement of all eligible exclusive representatives; and

(2) Five trustees to represent public employers.

Section 26-34 shall not apply to board member selection and terms. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no exclusive representative of a bargaining unit that sponsors or participates in a voluntary employee beneficiary association shall be eligible to select nominees or to be represented by a trustee on the board.

As used in this section, the term "exclusive representative" shall have the same meaning as in section 89-2\. [L 2001, c 88, pt of ยง1; am L 2005, c 250, ยง1]

Explanatory Note

L 2005, c 250 amendment. The legislature concluded that the governor's proclamation indicating the governor's intent to return H.B. No. 1548 was constitutionally defective and that said measure became law. On July 13, 2005, the legislature assigned Act 250 to H.B. No. 1548\. The attorney general has taken the position that H.B. No. 1548 did not become law.
