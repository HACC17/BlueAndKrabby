Case Notes

A retired employee's health benefits that are included in a health benefits plan falls within the constitutional protection contemplated by article XVI, ยง2 of the Hawaii constitution inasmuch as subsection (b) clearly and unambiguously conditions a retired state or county government employee's eligibility for health benefits on, inter alia, being a retired member of the employees' retirement system. 122 H. 402, 228 P.3d 282.
