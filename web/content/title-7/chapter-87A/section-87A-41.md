**[ยง87A-41] Employee-beneficiary or qualified-beneficiary contributions; long-term care benefits plan.** (a) During the period the long-term care benefits plan is in effect, the employee-beneficiary, if allowed by law, shall authorize the employee-beneficiary's contribution to be withheld and transmitted to the fund monthly by the comptroller, employees' retirement system, or finance officer who disburses the employee-beneficiary's compensation, pension, or retirement pay. If an employee-beneficiary's monthly contribution to the fund is not withheld and transmitted to the fund, the employee-beneficiary shall pay the monthly contribution directly to the board's designated carrier or third-party administrator as specified by the board.
