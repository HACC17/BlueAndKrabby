The term "person" means any individual or organization.

"Regular-service volunteer" means any person engaged in specific voluntary service activities on an on-going or continuous basis to an agency without receipt of any compensation, except as provided in this chapter.

"Stipended volunteer" means any person who by receiving a support allowance is then able to provide voluntary service to an agency. The allowance may be for food, lodging, or other personal living expenses and does not reflect compensation for work performed.
