Note

This chapter was extensively revised by L 2000, c 253.

**Prior history.**

This chapter is based upon L 1955, c 274, ยง1, which completely reenacted RL 1945, chapter 2\. Chapter 2 was based upon L 1939, c 187, and was amended by L 1947, cc 110, 119; L Sp 1949, cc 4, 45; L 1951, cc 155, 262, 319; L 1953, c 212\. Source notes following each section commence as of L 1955, c 274.

This chapter is revised to conform to L Sp 1959 2d, c 1, ยง11, which changed the state civil service administration by vesting in the state director of personnel services the administration of the state department of personnel services, including the authority to prescribe rules and regulations, and established the state civil service commission as an appellate body.

The law is further revised as superseded by the provisions of the county charters.

Attorney General Opinions

Because the procedure outlined in ยง76-2 is limited in its application to interpretations of this chapter and chapter 77, the constitutionality of any provision of the two chapters is an issue beyond the bounds of that process. Att. Gen. Op. 97-6.

Case Notes

City and County of Honolulu does not appear subject to chapter. 68 H. 432, 718 P.2d 1076.
