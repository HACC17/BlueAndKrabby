**ยง560:6-110 Financial institution protection; payment of payable-on-death account.** Any payable-on-death account may be paid, on request, to any original party to the account. Payment may be made, on request, to the payable-on-death payee or to the personal representative or heirs of a deceased payable-on-death payee upon presentation to the financial institution of proof of death showing that the payable-on-death payee survived all persons named as original payees. Payment may be made to the personal representative or heirs of a deceased original payee if proof of death is presented to the financial institution showing that his decedent was the survivor of all other persons named on the account either as an original payee or as payable-on-death payee.
