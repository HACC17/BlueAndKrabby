**ยง560:2-514** **Contracts concerning succession.** A contract to make a will or devise, or not to revoke a will or devise, or to die intestate, if executed after January 1, 1997, may be established only by:

(1) Provisions of a will stating material provisions of the contract;

(2) An express reference in a will to a contract and extrinsic evidence proving the terms of the contract; or

(3) A writing signed by the decedent evidencing the contract.

The execution of a joint will or mutual wills does not create a presumption of a contract not to revoke the will or wills. [L 1996, c 288, pt of ยง1]

Revision Note

"January 1, 1997" substituted for "the effective date of this article".
