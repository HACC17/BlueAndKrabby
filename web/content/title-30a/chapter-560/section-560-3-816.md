**§560:3-816** **Final distribution to domiciliary representative.** The estate of a non-resident decedent being administered by a personal representative appointed in this State, if there is a personal representative of the decedent's domicile willing to receive it, shall be distributed to the domiciliary personal representative for the benefit of the successors of the decedent unless:

(1) By virtue of the decedent's will, if any, and applicable choice of law rules, the successors are identified pursuant to the local law of this State without reference to the local law of the decedent's domicile;

(2) The personal representative of this State, after reasonable inquiry, is unaware of the existence or identity of a domiciliary personal representative; or

(3) The court orders otherwise in a proceeding for a closing order under section 560:3-1001 or incident to the closing of a supervised administration.

In other cases, distribution of the estate of a decedent shall be made in accordance with the other parts of this article. [L 1996, c 288, pt of §1]
