**ยง560:3-109** **Statutes of limitation on decedent's cause of action.** No statute of limitation running on a cause of action belonging to a decedent which had not been barred as of the date of the decedent's death, shall apply to bar a cause of action surviving the decedent's death sooner than four months after death. A cause of action which, but for this section, would have been barred less than four months after death, is barred after four months unless tolled. [L 1996, c 288, pt of ยง1]
