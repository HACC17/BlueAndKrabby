**ยง560:3-504** **Supervised administration; powers of personal representative.** Unless restricted by the court, a supervised personal representative has, without interim orders approving exercise of a power, all powers of personal representatives under this chapter, but the personal representative shall not exercise the personal representative's power to make any distribution of the estate without prior order of the court. Any other restriction on the power of a personal representative which may be ordered by the court must be endorsed on the personal representative's letters of appointment and, unless so endorsed, is ineffective as to persons dealing in good faith with the personal representative. [L 1996, c 288, pt of ยง1]
