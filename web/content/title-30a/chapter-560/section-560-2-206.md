**ยง560:2-206** **Decedent's nonprobate transfers to the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary.** Excluding property passing to the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary under the federal social security system, the value of the augmented estate includes the value of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to the decedent's surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, which consist of all property that passed outside probate at the decedent's death from the decedent to the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary by reason of the decedent's death, including:

(1) The decedent's fractional interest in property held as a joint tenant with the right of survivorship, to the extent that the decedent's fractional interest passed to the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary as surviving joint tenant;

(2) The decedent's ownership interest in property or accounts held in co-ownership registration with the right of survivorship, to the extent the decedent's ownership interest passed to the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary as surviving co-owner; and

(3) All other property that would have been included in the augmented estate under section 560:2-205(1) or (2) had it passed to or for the benefit of a person other than the decedent's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, the decedent, or the decedent's creditors, estate or estate creditors.
