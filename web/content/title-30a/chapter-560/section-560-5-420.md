**ยง560:5-420 Reports; appointment of kokua kanawai.** (a) A conservator shall file a petition for approval of accounts and report to the court for administration of the estate annually unless the court otherwise directs, upon resignation or removal, upon termination of the conservatorship, and at other times as the court directs. An order allowing an intermediate report of a conservator adjudicates liabilities concerning the matters adequately disclosed in the accounting. An order allowing a final report adjudicates all previously unsettled liabilities relating to the conservatorship, and, subject to appeal and subject to vacation, is final as to all persons with respect to all issues concerning the estate that the court considered or might have considered.

(b) A report shall include:

(1) A list of the assets of the estate under the conservator's control and a list of the receipts, disbursements, and distributions during the period for which the report is made;

(2) A list of the services provided to the protected person; and

(3) Any recommended changes in the budget for the conservatorship as well as a recommendation as to the continued need for conservatorship and any recommended changes in the scope of the conservatorship.

(c) The court may appoint a kokua kanawai to review a report or budget, interview the protected person or conservator, and make any other investigation the court directs. In connection with a report, the court may order a conservator to submit the assets of the estate to an appropriate examination to be made in a manner the court directs. [L 2004, c 161, pt of ยง1]
