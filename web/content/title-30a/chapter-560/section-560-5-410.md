**ยง560:5-410 Powers of court**. (a) After hearing and upon determining that a basis for a conservatorship or other protective order exists, the court shall have the following powers which may be exercised directly or through a conservator:

(1) With respect to a minor for reasons of age, all the powers over the estate and business affairs of the minor which may be necessary for the best interest of the minor and members of the minor's immediate family; and

(2) With respect to an adult, or to a minor for reasons other than age, for the benefit of the protected person and individuals who are in fact dependent on the protected person for support, all the powers over the estate and business affairs of the protected person that the person could exercise if the person were an adult, present, and not under conservatorship or other protective order.

(b) Subject to section 560:5-110 requiring endorsement of limitations on the letters of office, the court may limit at any time the powers of a conservator otherwise conferred and may remove or modify any limitation. [L 2004, c 161, pt of ยง1]
