**ยง560:2-608** **Exercise of power of appointment.** In the absence of a requirement that a power of appointment be exercised by a reference, or by an express or specific reference, to the power, a general residuary clause in a will, or a will making general disposition of all of the testator's property, expresses an intention to exercise a power of appointment held by the testator only if:

(1) The power is a general power and the creating instrument does not contain a gift if the power is not exercised; or

(2) The testator's will manifests an intention to include the property subject to the power. [L 1996, c 288, pt of ยง1]
