**ยง560:5-417 Compensation and expenses.** If not otherwise compensated for services rendered, a guardian, conservator, physician, lawyer for the respondent, lawyer whose services resulted in a protective order or in an order beneficial to a protected person's estate, or any person appointed by the court is entitled to reasonable compensation from the estate, even if no guardian or conservator is appointed. Compensation may be paid and expenses reimbursed without court order. If the court or the family court determines that the compensation is excessive or the expenses are inappropriate, the excessive or inappropriate amount shall be repaid to the estate.
