**ยง560:7-203 Trust proceedings; dismissal of matters relating to foreign trusts.** The court will not, over the objection of a party, entertain proceedings concerning the internal affairs of a trust registered or having its principal place of administration in another state, unless (1) all appropriate parties could not be bound by litigation in the courts of the state where the trust is registered or has its principal place of administration or (2) the interests of justice otherwise would seriously be impaired. The court may condition a stay or dismissal of a proceeding under this section on the consent of any party to jurisdiction of the state in which the trust is registered or has its principal place of business, or the court may grant a continuance or enter any other appropriate order. [L 1976, c 200, pt of ยง1]
