**§560:6-102 Ownership as between parties, and others; protection of financial institutions.** The provisions of sections 560:6-103 to 560:6-105 concerning beneficial ownership as between parties and payable-on-death payees, or as between parties or beneficiaries of multiple-party accounts, are relevant only to controversies between these persons and their creditors and other successors, and have no bearing on the power of withdrawal of these persons as determined by the terms of account contracts. The provisions of sections 560:6-108 to 560:6-113 govern the liability of financial institutions who make payments pursuant thereto, and their setoff rights. [L 1976, c 200, pt of §1]
