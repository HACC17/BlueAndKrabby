(1) Legally obligated to use the guardian's personal funds for the ward's expenses;

(2) Unless otherwise provided in the contract, individually liable on a contract properly entered into in the guardian's representative capacity in the exercise of the duties and powers as guardian unless the guardian fails to reveal the guardian's capacity and the identity of the ward in the contract;
