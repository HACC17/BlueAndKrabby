Case Notes

As no "particular provision" in chapter 560 displaces a right of access to probate proceedings and records, third parties have a right to file petitions challenging the closure of probate court proceedings or the sealing of court records under a principle of law supplementing the probate code. 106 H. 453, 106 P.3d 1096.
