**ยง560:7-102 Registration procedures.** Registration shall be accomplished by filing a statement indicating the name and address of the trustee in which it acknowledges the trusteeship. The statement shall indicate whether the trust has been registered elsewhere. The statement shall identify the trust:

(1) In the case of a testamentary trust, by the name of the testator and the date and place of domiciliary probate;

(2) In the case of a written inter vivos trust, by the name of each settlor and the original trustee and the date of the trust instrument.

If a trust has been registered elsewhere, registration in this State is ineffective until the earlier registration is released by order of the court where prior registration occurred, or an instrument executed by the trustee and all beneficiaries, filed with the registration in this State. [L 1976, c 200, pt of ยง1]
