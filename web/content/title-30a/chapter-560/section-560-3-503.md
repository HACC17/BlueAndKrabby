**ยง560:3-503** **Supervised administration; effect on other proceedings.** (a) The pendency of a proceeding for supervised administration of a decedent's estate stays action on any informal application then pending or thereafter filed.

(b) If a will has been previously probated in informal proceedings, the effect of the filing of a petition for supervised administration is as provided for formal testacy proceedings by section 560:3-401.

(c) After the personal representative has received notice of the filing of a petition for supervised administration, a personal representative who has been appointed previously shall not exercise the personal representative's power to distribute any estate. The filing of the petition does not affect the personal representative's other powers and duties unless the court restricts the exercise of any of them pending full hearing on the petition. [L 1996, c 288, pt of ยง1]
