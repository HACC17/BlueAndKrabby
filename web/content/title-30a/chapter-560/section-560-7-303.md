**§560:7-303 Duty to inform and account to beneficiaries.** The trustee shall keep the beneficiaries of the trust reasonably informed of the trust and its administration; provided, however, during the life of the settlor, the trustee of a revocable inter vivos trust shall not be required to register the trust, reveal the terms to beneficiaries, or account to beneficiaries, unless otherwise directed by the settlor. In addition:

(1) Within thirty days after the trustee's acceptance of the trust, the trustee shall inform in writing the persons currently entitled to benefits from the trust, and if possible, one or more persons who under section 560:1-403 may represent beneficiaries with future interests, of the court in which the trust is registered and of the trustee's name and address.

(2) Upon reasonable request, the trustee shall provide the beneficiary with a copy of the terms of the trust which describe or affect the beneficiary's interest and with information about the assets of the trust and the particulars relating to the administration.

(3) Upon reasonable request, a beneficiary is entitled to a statement of the accounts of the trust annually and on termination of the trust or change of the trustee. [L 1976, c 200, pt of §1; gen ch 1985; am L 1997, c 244, §13]
