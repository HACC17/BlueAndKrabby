**ยง560:3-1008** **Subsequent administration.** If other property of the estate is discovered after an estate has been settled and the personal representative discharged or after one year after a closing statement has been filed, the court upon petition of any interested person and upon notice as it directs may appoint the same or a successor personal representative to administer the subsequently discovered estate. If a new appointment is made, unless the court orders otherwise, the provisions of this chapter apply as appropriate; but no claim previously barred may be asserted in the subsequent administration. [L 1996, c 288, pt of ยง1]
