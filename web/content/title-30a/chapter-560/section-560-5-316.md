**§560:5-316 Rights and immunities of guardian; limitations.** (a) A guardian shall be entitled to such reasonable compensation from the ward's estate for services as guardian and to reimbursement for room, board, and clothing provided to the ward, as is approved by order of the court.

(b) A guardian is not:

(1) Legally obligated to use the guardian's personal funds for the ward's expenses;

(2) Unless otherwise provided in the contract, individually liable on a contract properly entered into in the guardian's representative capacity in the exercise of the duties and powers as guardian unless the guardian fails to reveal the guardian's capacity and the identity of the ward in the contract;

(3) Personally liable to a third person for acts of the ward solely by reason of the relationship; and

(4) Liable for injury to the ward resulting from the wrongful conduct of a third party that provides medical or other care, treatment, or service to the ward, if the guardian exercised reasonable care in choosing the third party.

(c) A guardian, without authorization of the court, shall not:

(1) Revoke any health care directions set forth in any medical directive or health care power of attorney of which the ward is the principal; provided that the appointment of a guardian shall automatically terminate the authority of any agent designated in the medical directive or health care power of attorney; or

(2) Restrict the personal communication rights of the ward, including the right to receive visitors, telephone calls, and personal mail, unless deemed by the guardian to pose a risk to the safety or well-being of the ward.

(d) A guardian shall not initiate the commitment of a ward to a mental health-care institution except in accordance with the State's procedure for involuntary civil commitment. [L 2004, c 161, pt of §1; am L 2016, c 89, §1]
