**ยง560:5-418 General duties of conservator**. (a) A conservator, in relation to powers conferred by this article or implicit in the title acquired by virtue of the proceeding, shall be a fiduciary and shall observe the standards of care applicable to a trustee.

(b) A conservator may exercise authority only as necessitated by the limitations of the protected person, and to the extent possible, shall encourage the person to participate in decisions, act in the person's own behalf, and develop or regain the ability to manage the person's estate and business affairs.

(c) In investing an estate, selecting assets of the estate for distribution, and invoking powers of revocation or withdrawal available for the use and benefit of the protected person and exercisable by the conservator, a conservator shall take into account any estate plan of the person known to the conservator and may examine the will and any other donative, nominative, or other appointive instrument of the person.
