**ยง560:3-1206** **Publication by clerk of appointment as personal representative; notice to creditors, heirs, etc.** (a) If the estate has a total value of $10,000 or less, upon such appointment the clerk shall publish the fact by posting a notice thereof at the front entrance of the court house of the judicial circuit and by advertising the notice in the English language at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial circuit, the notice to state briefly that all creditors of the deceased must file with the clerk duly verified claims within sixty days from the date of publication, and that all persons claiming to be heirs of the estate are requested to file with the clerk notice of such claims within the period. The court may direct that the advertising of the notice in a newspaper need not be made if it deems the same unnecessary.

(b) If the estate has a total value in excess of $10,000, the content and method of giving notice, both of the pendency of the action and of all other acts for which notice is required, shall be as provided for informal probates in article III, part 3\. [L 1996, c 288, pt of ยง1]
