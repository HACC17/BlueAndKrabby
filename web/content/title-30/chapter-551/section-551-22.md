**§551-22 Estates less than $100.** When the whole estate of a person over the age of eighteen for whom a conservator could be appointed does not exceed the value of $100, the court, in its discretion, without the appointment of a conservator or the giving of bond, may authorize the deposit thereof in a depository authorized to receive fiduciary funds in the name of a suitable person designated by the court, or if the assets do not consist of money, authorize the delivery thereof to a suitable person designated by the court. The person receiving such money or other assets shall hold and dispose of the same in such manner as the court shall direct.
