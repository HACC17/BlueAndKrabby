**[ยง551E-4] Nomination of conservator or guardian; relation of agent to court-appointed fiduciary.** (a) In a power of attorney, a principal may nominate a conservator or guardian of the principal's estate, or conservator or guardian of the principal's person for consideration by the court if protective proceedings for the principal's estate or person are begun after the principal executes the power of attorney. Except for good cause shown or disqualification, the court shall make its appointment in accordance with the principal's most recent nomination.

(b) If, after a principal executes a power of attorney, a court appoints a guardian of the principal's estate or other fiduciary charged with the management of some or all of the principal's property, the agent shall be accountable to the fiduciary as well as to the principal. The power of attorney shall not be terminated and the agent's authority shall continue unless limited, suspended, or terminated by the court. [L 2014, c 22, pt of ยง1]
