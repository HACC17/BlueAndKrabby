**[ยง553A-7] Transfer by obligor.** (a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c), a person not subject to section 553A-5 or 553A-6 who holds property of or owes a liquidated debt to a minor not having a conservator may make an irrevocable transfer to a custodian for the benefit of the minor pursuant to section 553A-9.

(b) If a person having the right to do so under section 553A-3 has nominated a custodian under that section to receive the custodial property, the transfer must be made to that person.

(c) If no custodian has been nominated under section 553A-3, or all persons so nominated as custodian die before the transfer or are unable, decline, or are ineligible to serve, a transfer under this section may be made to an adult member of the minor's family or to a trust company unless the property exceeds $10,000 in value.
