**[ยง551A-5] Fees for services; when not allowed.** (a) The public guardian may receive such reasonable fees for services as public guardian as the court allows.

(b) No fees shall be allowed which would unreasonably diminish the ward's estate so as to endanger the ward's financial independence, and no fees shall be allowed when the ward's primary source of support derives from public funds.

(c) Any fees received under this section by the public guardian shall be deposited in the state general fund.

(d) No fees shall accrue to the individual benefit of the public guardian. [L 1984, c 223, pt of ยง1]
