**[ยง431L-5] Recoupment of amounts spent on child medical care.** The department of the attorney general may garnish the wages, salary, or other employment income of, and withhold amounts from state tax refunds to, any person who:

(1) Is required by court or administrative order to provide coverage of the cost of health services to a child eligible for medical assistance under medicaid; and

(2) Has received payment from a third party for the costs of such services but has not used the payments to reimburse either the other parent or guardian of the child or the provider of the services,

to the extent necessary to reimburse the department of human services for its costs, but claims for current and past due child support shall take priority over these claims. [L 1995, c 83, pt of ยง2]
