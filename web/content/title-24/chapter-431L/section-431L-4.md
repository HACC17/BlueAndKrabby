**ยง431L-4 Employer obligations.** Where a parent is required by a court or administrative order to provide health coverage, which is available through an employer doing business in this State, the employer is required:

(1) To permit the parent to enroll under family coverage, as defined in section 431:10A-103 or reciprocal beneficiary family coverage, as defined in section 431:10A-601, any child who is otherwise eligible for coverage without regard to any enrollment season restrictions;

(2) If the parent is enrolled but fails to make application to obtain coverage of the child, to enroll the child under family coverage or reciprocal beneficiary family coverage upon application by the child's other parent, by the state agency administering the medicaid program, or by the state agency administering the child support enforcement program;

(3) Not to disenroll (or eliminate coverage of) any such child unless the employer is provided satisfactory written evidence that:

(A) The court or administrative order is no longer in effect;

(B) The child is or will be enrolled in comparable coverage which will take effect no later than the effective date of disenrollment; or

(C) The employer has eliminated family health coverage or reciprocal beneficiary family coverage for all of its employees; and

(4) To withhold from the employee's compensation the employee's share (if any) of premiums for health coverage and to pay this amount to the insurer. [L 1995, c 83, pt of ยง2; am L 1997, c 383, ยง9]
