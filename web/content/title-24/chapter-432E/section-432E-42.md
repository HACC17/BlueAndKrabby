**[****§432E-42] Funding of external review.** The health carrier against which a request for a standard external review or an expedited external review is filed shall pay the cost of the independent review organization for conducting the external review. There shall be no recourse against the commissioner for the cost of conducting the external review and the selection of an independent review organization shall not be subject to chapter 103D; provided that the commissioner may initially approve up to three independent review organizations to serve beginning on the effective date of this part until the initial procurement process is completed; provided further that in any year in which procurement subject to chapter 103D does not produce at least three independent review organizations eligible for selection under section 432E-39, the commissioner may approve up to three independent review organizations notwithstanding the requirements of chapter 103D. [L 2011, c 230, pt of §2]
