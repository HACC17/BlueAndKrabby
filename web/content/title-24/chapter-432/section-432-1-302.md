**ยง432:1-302 Commissioner refusal to authorize certificate or solicitation; appeal to circuit court.** (a) If the commissioner reasonably believes that the financial plan of the society is unsound or not feasible from an actuarial or other accounting standpoint, the commissioner shall refuse to issue a certificate, authorize the society to solicit members, or engage in business.

(b) Any person aggrieved by the decision of the commissioner refusing to issue the certificate, or to authorize the society to solicit members, or to engage in business, may within twenty days after the decision appeal to the circuit court of the circuit in which the society proposes to have its principal place of business. The procedure upon appeal shall be the same as in the case of other appeals to the circuit court in civil cases. The court shall hear the appeal without a jury. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2]
