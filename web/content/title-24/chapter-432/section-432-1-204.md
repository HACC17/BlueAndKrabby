**ยง432:1-204** **Foreign societies.** Any foreign society subject to this article shall not be excused or relieved from compliance with this article by reason of the nonresidence of its members. Upon a showing to the satisfaction of the commissioner that it is impracticable and would work a hardship to comply with section 432:1-202(b) the commissioner shall permit the society to qualify in this respect upon its appointment of a resident agent, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as are provided for in the case of foreign corporations under the general laws on corporations. Section 432:1-202(b) shall likewise be applicable to the agent. [L 1989, c 195, ยง9]
