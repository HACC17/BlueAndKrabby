**[ยง435C-11] Initiation of plan.** The plan becomes operational at the direction of the insurance commissioner, upon a finding that medical malpractice insurance is not or will not be readily available in this State to the majority of the physicians and hospitals. Upon a finding by the insurance commissioner that medical malpractice insurance has become readily available in the voluntary market, the commissioner may direct the plan to cease writing medical malpractice insurance.

The plan, being a temporary measure, shall not remain in existence for more than three years after the plan becomes operational. [L 1975, c 161, pt of ยง1; gen ch 1985]
