**ยง431N-6** **Reporting, continued funding.** The department of health shall report to the legislature on or about October 1, 1989, on the progress made in implementation of this chapter, including:

(1) Establishment of an advisory committee to review: the scope of the work to be done by a consultant, the input from the committee and the community to the consultant, and the schedule of work of the advisory committee;

(2) Final scope of work for the consultant, selection of the consultant, and the consultant's workplan;

(3) Involvement of the departments of labor and industrial relations, human services, and other departments needed to successfully develop the program;

(4) Required data collection efforts to successfully develop the program.

The department of health, in collaboration with the health care contractors, shall submit reports to the legislature and the governor no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each and every legislative session regarding program activities and expenditures, needed resources, participant demographics, evaluations, and such other information as may be necessary to determine the usefulness of and continued need for the state health insurance program.

The purchase of insurance shall not proceed without the formal approval of the governor and a review by the legislature during the 1990 regular session. Implementation is predicated upon the successful completion of the consultant's reports and findings. The legislature, by concurrent resolution, may opt to withhold funding appropriated for implementation if not satisfied with the plan, provided that such a concurrent resolution must be passed within thirty days after completion of the implementation plan or March 1, 1990, whichever occurs last.
