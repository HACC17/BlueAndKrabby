**[ยง431K-3.5] Registration fees and service fees of risk** **retention groups not chartered in this State.** (a) A risk retention group chartered in states other than this State and seeking to do business as a risk retention group in this State shall pay an initial registration fee of $300 to the commissioner and shall thereafter pay annually a service fee of $150 on or before August 16 of each year in which the risk retention group intends to do business in this State.

(b) If the service fee is not paid on or before August 16 of the year in which payment is due, a penalty shall be imposed in the amount of fifty per cent of the service fee. The commissioner shall provide written notice of the delinquency of payment and the imposition of the authorized penalty. If the service fee and the penalty are not paid within thirty days immediately following the date of the notice of delinquency, the commissioner may revoke the registration of the risk retention group and may not reinstate the registration until the service fee and the penalty have been paid.
