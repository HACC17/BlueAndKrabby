**[ยง431K-1.5] Financial responsibility.** Whenever pursuant to the laws of this State or any county of this State a demonstration of financial responsibility is required as a condition for obtaining a license or permit to undertake specified activities, if any such requirement may not be satisfied by obtaining insurance from an insurance company not authorized in this State, then such requirement may not be satisfied by purchasing insurance from a risk retention group not chartered in this State. [L 1989, c 272, ยง1]
