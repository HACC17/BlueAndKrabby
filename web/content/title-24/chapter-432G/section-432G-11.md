(b) Every dental insurer and provider shall submit its books and records for examination and in every way facilitate the completion of an examination by the commissioner. In the event a dental insurer or a provider fails to comply with the directions of the commissioner, the commissioner may examine the affiliates of the dental insurer or provider to obtain the information. For the purpose of examinations, the commissioner may administer oaths to and examine the officers and agents of the dental insurer and the principals of providers concerning their business.

(c) The cost of examinations under this section shall be assessed against the dental insurer or provider being examined and shall be remitted to the commissioner for deposit into the compliance resolution fund.
