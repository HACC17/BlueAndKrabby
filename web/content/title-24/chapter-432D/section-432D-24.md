**[ยง432D-24] Coordination of benefits.** (a) Health maintenance organizations are permitted, but not required to adopt provisions for coordination of benefits to avoid overinsurance and to provide for the orderly payment of claims when a person is covered by two or more group health insurance or health care plans.

(b) If health maintenance organizations adopt provisions for coordination of benefits, the provisions must be consistent with the coordination of benefits provisions that are in general use in the State for coordinating coverage between two or more group health insurance or health care plans.
