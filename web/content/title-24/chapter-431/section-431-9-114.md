(b) To appoint a producer as its agent, the appointing insurer or producer shall file, in a format approved by the commissioner, a notice of appointment within fifteen days from the date the agency or business entity contract is executed or the first insurance application is submitted to the insurer or producer.

(c) Upon receipt of the notice of appointment and within a reasonable time not to exceed thirty days, the commissioner shall verify that the insurance producer is eligible for appointment. If the insurance producer is determined to be ineligible for appointment, the commissioner shall notify the appointing insurer or producer within five days of its determination.
