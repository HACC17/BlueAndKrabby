**§431:4-321 Nonassessable policies.** (a) A domestic mutual insurer, after it has established a surplus not less in amount than the minimum capital funds required of a domestic stock insurer to transact like classes of insurance, may extinguish the contingent liability of its members to assessment and omit provisions imposing contingent liability in all policies currently issued.

(b) When the surplus has been so established and the commissioner has so ascertained, the commissioner shall issue to the insurer, at its request, the commissioner's certificate authorizing the extinguishment of the contingent liability of its members and the issuance of policies free therefrom.

(c) While it maintains surplus funds in amount not less than the minimum paid-up capital stock and surplus required of a domestic stock insurer authorized to transact like classes of insurance, a foreign or alien mutual insurer may, if consistent with its charter and the laws of its domicile, issue nonassessable policies covering subjects located, resident, or to be performed in this State. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2]
