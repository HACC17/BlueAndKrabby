**§431:10D-502 Definitions.** For the purposes of this part:

"Direct-response solicitation" means a solicitation through a sponsoring or endorsing entity or individual solely through mails, telephone, the Internet, or other mass communication media.

"Existing insurer" means the insurance company whose policy or contract is or will be changed or affected in a manner described within the definition of replacement.

"Existing policy or contract" means an individual life insurance policy (policy) or annuity contract (contract) in force, including a policy under a binding or conditional receipt or a policy or contract that is within an unconditional refund period.

"Financed purchase" means the purchase of a new policy involving the actual or intended use of funds obtained by the withdrawal or surrender of, or by borrowing from values of an existing policy to pay all or part of any premium due on the new policy. For purposes of a regulatory review of an individual transaction only, if a withdrawal, surrender, or borrowing involving the policy values of an existing policy is used to pay premiums on a new policy owned by the same policyholder and issued by the same company within four months before or thirteen months after the effective date of the new policy, it shall be deemed prima facie evidence of the policyholder's intent to finance the purchase of the new policy with existing policy values. This prima facie standard is not intended to increase or decrease the monitoring obligations contained in section 431:10D-504(1)(E).

"Illustration" means a presentation or depiction that includes non-guaranteed elements of a policy of life insurance over a period of years as defined in part IV of this article.

(2) For universal life policies, means a written statement that shall contain at least the following information: the beginning and end date of the current report period; the policy value at the end of the previous report period and at the end of the current report period; the total amounts that have been credited or debited to the policy value during the current report period, identifying each by type (e.g., interest, mortality, expense, and riders); the current death benefit at the end of the current report period on each life covered by the policy; the net cash surrender value of the policy as of the end of the current report period; and the amount of outstanding loans, if any, as of the end of the current report period.

"Producer" includes any person, firm, association, or corporation licensed pursuant to article 9A.

"Registered contract" means a variable annuity contract or variable life insurance policy subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.

(1) Lapsed, forfeited, surrendered or partially surrendered, assigned to the replacing insurer, or otherwise terminated;

(2) Converted to reduced paid-up insurance, continued as extended term insurance, or otherwise reduced in value by the use of nonforfeiture benefits or other policy values;

(3) Amended so as to effect either a reduction in benefits or in the term for which coverage would otherwise remain in force or for which benefits would be paid;

(4) Reissued with any reduction in cash value; or

(5) Used in a financed purchase.

"Replacing insurer" means the insurance company that issues or proposes to issue a new policy or contract that replaces an existing policy or contract or is a financed purchase.
