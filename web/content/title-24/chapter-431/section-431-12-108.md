**ยง431:12-108 Employer's failure to remit premiums.** If any employer is required under a mass merchandising agreement to collect the premiums from its employees and remit the same to the insurer, its failure to so collect and remit as to any employee for any reason, including termination of the employee's employment, shall not be regarded by the insurer as nonpayment of premium by such employee, unless the insurer gives written notice of such failure to remit to the employee and the employee fails to pay the required premium by the later of:

(1) Thirty days after the mailing or delivery of the notice to the address of the employee last known to the insurer, or

(2) The due date of the premium. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2]
