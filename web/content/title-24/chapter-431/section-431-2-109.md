(b) No cause of action shall arise, nor shall any liability be imposed against any person for the act of communicating or delivering information or data to the commissioner, the commissioner's authorized representative, or the examiner pursuant to an examination made under this article, if the act of communication or delivery was performed in good faith and without fraudulent intent or the intent to deceive.
