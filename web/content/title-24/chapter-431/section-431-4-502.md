**ยง431:4-502 Mutualization of stock insurers.** (a) Any domestic stock insurer may become a domestic mutual insurer pursuant to such plan and procedure as are approved by the commissioner in advance of such mutualization.

(b) The commissioner shall not approve any such plan, procedure, or mutualization unless:

(1) It is equitable to both shareholders and policyholders.

(2) It is approved by vote of the holders of not less than three-fourths of the insurer's capital stock having voting rights, and by vote of not less than two-thirds of the insurer's policyholders who vote on such plan, pursuant to such notice and procedure as may be approved by the commissioner; provided that in the case of a life insurer, the right to vote thereon is limited to those policyholders whose policies have face amounts of not less than $1,000 and have been in force one year or more. Such vote may be registered in person, by proxy, or by mail.

(3) Mutualization will result in retirement of shares of the insurer's capital stock at a price not in excess of the fair value thereof as determined by competent disinterested appraisers.

(4) The plan provides for appraisal and purchase of the shares of any nonconsenting stockholder in accordance with the laws of this State relating to the sale or exchange of all the assets of a private corporation.

(5) The plan provides for definite conditions to be fulfilled by a designated early date upon which such mutualization will be deemed effective.

(6) Mutualization leaves the insurer with surplus funds reasonably adequate to preserve the security of its policyholders and its ability to continue successfully in business in the states in which it is then authorized, and in the classes of insurance it is then authorized to transact.
