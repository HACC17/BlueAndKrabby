(2) A business entity, general agency, independent agency, or the insurance producer to take reasonably appropriate corrective action for any consumer harmed by the insurance producer's violation of this part; and

(3) Appropriate penalties and sanctions.

(b)  Any penalty applicable to an insurer, a managing general agent, independent agencies, or a producer under article 13 of chapter 431 may be applicable to a violation of this part; provided that penalties may be reduced or eliminated if corrective action for the consumer was taken promptly after a violation was discovered or if the violation was not part of a pattern or practice.
