**[ยง431:10C-607] Revocation of certificate of self-insurance.** The commissioner may revoke a certificate of self-insurance for good cause at any time after providing notice and the opportunity for a hearing in accordance with chapter 91\. Failure to comply with this article, rules, orders, or directives of the commissioner, or to pay any lawful fee or assessment is cause for revocation. Upon a revocation, the owner of any self-insured motor vehicle shall not operate or permit operation of the vehicle in the State until the owner has obtained insurance or has received a new certificate of self-insurance from the commissioner. [L 2000, c 24, pt of ยง3]
