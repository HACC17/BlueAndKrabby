**§431:3-219 Suspension period; revocation.** (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this code, the commissioner may suspend an insurer's certificate of authority for a period not to exceed one year. The commissioner shall state in the commissioner's order of suspension the period during which it shall be effective.

(b) After the completion of the original suspension period, the commissioner may order additional extensions of the suspension or revoke an insurer's certificate of authority pursuant to section 431:3-218, provided there is a basis for the extended suspension or revocation and the insurer has an opportunity for a hearing prior to the imposition of the extended suspension or revocation.
