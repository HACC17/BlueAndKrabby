**§431:11-112 Receivership.** Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any person has committed a violation of this article which so impairs the financial condition of a domestic insurer as to threaten insolvency or make the further transaction of business by it hazardous to its policyholders, creditors, shareholders, or the public, then the commissioner may proceed as provided in article 15 to take possession of the property of the domestic insurer and to conduct the business thereof. [L 1987, c 349, pt of §8]
