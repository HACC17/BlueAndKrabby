**ยง431:12-107 Payroll deductions and premium collections.** A mass merchandising agreement may provide for the collection of premiums from employees by payroll deductions, assessments, or otherwise, and the remittance of the same to the insurer by the employer; provided that:

(1) No such collection and remittance of premiums by the employer shall constitute collection of premium within the meaning of this code;

(2) No act of furnishing information about such collection method by the employer to its employees shall constitute solicitation of applications for insurance; and

(3) The employer shall not be considered an insurance producer for purposes of this code by virtue of the employer's collection and remittance of premiums or the furnishing of information about such collection method. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2; am L 2003, c 212, ยง102]
