**ยง431:5-305 Increased reserves.** (a) If the commissioner determines that an insurer's unearned premium reserves, however computed, are inadequate, the commissioner may require the insurer to compute such reserves or any part thereof according to such other method or methods as are prescribed in this code.

(b) If the loss reserves, however estimated, are inadequate, the commissioner shall require the insurer to maintain loss reserves in such increased amount as is needed to make them adequate. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2]
