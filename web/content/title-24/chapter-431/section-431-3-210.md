**ยง431:3-210 Determination of capital funds of alien insurer.** (a) The capital funds of an alien insurer shall be deemed to be the amount by which its assets exceed its liabilities with respect to its business transacted in the United States.

(b) Assets of such insurer held in any state for the special protection of policyholders and obligees in such state shall not constitute assets of the insurer for the purpose of this code. Liabilities of the insurer so secured by such assets but not exceeding the amount of such assets, may be deducted in computing the insurer's liabilities for the purpose of this section.
