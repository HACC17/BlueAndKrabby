(b) The commissioner shall approve an assessment of member insurers by the association when the association is insolvent as defined in section [431:15-103(a)].

(c) The commissioner may suspend or revoke after a hearing the certificate of authority of any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation.
