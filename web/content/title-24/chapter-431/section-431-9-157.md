**[§431:9A-157] Tuition.** (a) The following are requirements that providers shall follow:

(1) Tuition fees for courses shall be reasonable and clearly identified;

(2) If the course is canceled for any reason, all fees shall be refunded in full unless the enrollment application contains a refund policy clause that expressly states otherwise. If the fees are refundable, the continuing education course provider shall refund the fees within forty-five days after the cancellation;

(3) In the event a course is postponed for any reason, a licensee shall be given the choice of attending the course at a later date or having the fee refunded in full. If a licensee chooses not to attend a postponed course, the continuing education course provider shall refund the fees within forty-five days after the postponement; and

(4) A provider may have a refund policy that addresses a licensee's cancellation or failure to complete a course, so long as that policy is clear to the licensee and in compliance with this section.

(b) A continuing education course provider may offer a continuing education course free of tuition. [L 2003, c 55, pt of §1]
