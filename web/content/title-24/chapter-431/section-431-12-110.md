**ยง431:12-110 Premium rates.** Premium rates for insurance sold on a mass merchandising basis shall comply with the standards in article 10C for motor vehicle insurance and in article 14 for property and casualty insurance including the standards that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.

Rates shall not be deemed to be unfairly discriminatory because different premiums result for policyholders with like loss exposure but different expense factors, or like expense factors but different loss exposures, so long as the rates reflect the differences with reasonable accuracy. Rates shall not be deemed to be unfairly discriminatory if they are averaged broadly among persons insured under a mass merchandising plan. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2]
