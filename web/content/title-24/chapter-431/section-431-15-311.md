**ยง431:15-311 Notice to creditors and others.** (a) Unless the court otherwise directs, the liquidator shall give or cause to be given notice of the liquidation order as soon as possible by:

(1) First class mail and by telegram, telephone, or other electronic communication to the commissioner of each jurisdiction in which the insurer is doing business;

(2) First class mail to any guaranty association or foreign guaranty association who is or may become obligated as a result of the liquidation;

(3) First class mail to all insurance producers of the insurer;

(4) First class mail to all persons known or reasonably expected to have claims against the insurer including all policyholders, at their last known address as indicated by the records of the insurer; and

(5) Publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business and in such other locations as the liquidator deems appropriate.

(b) Notice to potential claimants under subsection (a) shall require claimants to file with the liquidator their claims together with proper proofs thereof under section 431:15-326, on or before a date the liquidator shall specify in the notice. The liquidator need not require persons claiming cash surrender values or other investment values in life insurance and annuities to file a claim. All claimants shall have a duty to keep the liquidator informed of any changes of address.

(c) If notice is given in accordance with this section, the distribution of assets of the insurer under this article shall be conclusive with respect to all claimants, whether or not they received notice. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2; am L 2002, c 155, ยง85; am L 2003, c 212, ยง109]
