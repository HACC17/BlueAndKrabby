**ยง431:4-416 Subscriber's liability.** (a) The liability of each subscriber subject to assessment for the obligations of the reciprocal insurer shall not be joint, but shall be individual and several.

(b) Each subscriber who is subject to assessment shall have a contingent assessment liability, in the amount provided for in the power of attorney or in the subscribers' agreement, for payment of actual losses and expenses incurred while the subscriber's policy was in force. The contingent liability may be at the rate of not less than one nor more than ten times the premium or premium deposit stated in the policy, and the maximum aggregate thereof shall be computed in the manner set forth in section 431:4-418.

(c) Each assessable policy issued by the insurer shall plainly set forth a statement of contingent liability. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2]
