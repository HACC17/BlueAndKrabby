**ยง431:15-318 Claims of holders of void or voidable rights.** (a) No claims of a creditor who has received or acquired a preference, lien, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or encumbrance, voidable under this article, shall be allowed unless the creditor surrenders the preference, lien, conveyance, transfer, assignment or encumbrance. If the avoidance is effected by a proceeding in which a final judgment has been entered, the claim shall not be allowed unless the money is paid or the property is delivered to the liquidator within thirty days from the date of the entering of the final judgment, except that the court having jurisdiction over the liquidation may allow further time if there is an appeal or other continuation of the proceeding.

(b) A claim allowable under subsection (a) by reason of the avoidance, whether voluntary or involuntary, of a preference, lien, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or encumbrance, may be filed as an excused late filing under section 431:15-325 if filed within thirty days from the date of the avoidance, or within the further time allowed by the court under subsection (a).
