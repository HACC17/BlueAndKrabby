**ยง431:1-206 Property insurance defined.** Property insurance is insurance against loss of or damage to real or personal property of every kind and any interest therein, from any or all hazard or cause and against loss consequential upon such loss of or damage. An inclusion within other defined classes of insurance of the right to insure against certain designated perils to real or personal property shall not be deemed a diminution of the definition of property insurance. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2]
