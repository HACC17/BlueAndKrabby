**ยง431:4-422 Contributions of surplus.** The attorney or other parties may advance to the reciprocal insurer funds as it may require from time to time in its operations. Sums so advanced shall not be treated as a liability of the insurer, and shall not be withdrawn or repaid except out of the insurer's realized earned surplus in excess of its minimum required surplus. No such withdrawal or repayment shall be made without the advance approval of the commissioner. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2]
