**ยง431:4-111 Expiration and contents.** Every solicitation permit issued by the commissioner shall:

(1) Expire two years from its date, unless earlier terminated by the commissioner, and shall so state.

(2) State the securities for which subscriptions are to be solicited, the number, classes, par value, and selling price thereof, or identify the insurance contract for which applications and advance premiums or deposits are to be solicited.

(3) Limit the portion of funds received on account of stock subscriptions, if any are proposed to be taken, which may be used for promotion and organization expenses to such amount as the commissioner deems adequate, but in no event to exceed fifteen per cent of such funds as and when actually received.

(4) If to be for a mutual or reciprocal insurer, limit the portion of funds received on account of applications for insurance which may be used for promotion or organization expenses to a reasonable commission upon such funds, giving consideration to the class or classes of insurance and policy or policies involved and to the costs incurred by insurers generally in the production of similar business, and provide that no such commission shall be deemed to be earned nor be paid until the insurer has received its certificate of authority and the policies applied for, and upon which such commission is to be based, have been actually issued and delivered.

(5) Contain such other information required by this part or reasonable conditions relative to accounting and reports or otherwise as the commissioner deems necessary. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2]
