**ยง431:2-207 Contempt proceedings.** If any individual fails to obey the subpoena, or obeys the subpoena but refuses to testify when required concerning any matter under examination, investigation or the subject of the hearing, the commissioner shall file a written report thereof and proof of service of the commissioner's subpoena in the circuit court of the county where the examination, investigation or hearing is being conducted. Thereupon the court shall forthwith cause the individual to be brought before it to show cause why the individual should not be held in contempt, and if so held, may punish the individual as if the failure or refusal related to a subpoena from or testimony in that court. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2]
