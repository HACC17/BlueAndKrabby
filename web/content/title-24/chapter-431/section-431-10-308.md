**ยง431:10D-308 Facility of payment.** Such a policy may also provide that if the beneficiary designated in the policy does not surrender the policy with due proof of death within the period stated in the policy, which shall not be less than thirty days after the death of the insured, or if the beneficiary is the estate of the insured or is a minor, or dies before the insured or is not legally competent to give a valid release, then the insurer may make payment under the policy to the personal representative of the insured, or to any of the insured's relatives by blood, legal adoption or connection by marriage, or to any person appearing to the insurer to be equitably entitled to such payment by reason of having been named beneficiary, or by reason of having incurred expense for the maintenance, medical attention, or burial of the insured. The policy may also include a similar provision applicable to any other payment due under the policy. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2]
