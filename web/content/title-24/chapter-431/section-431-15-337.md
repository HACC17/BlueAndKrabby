**ยง431:15-337 Reopening liquidation.** After the liquidation proceeding has been terminated and the liquidator discharged, the commissioner or other interested party may at any time petition the circuit court of the first judicial circuit to reopen the proceedings for good cause, including the discovery of additional assets. If the court is satisfied that there is justification for reopening, it shall so order. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2]
