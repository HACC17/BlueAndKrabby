**ยง490:2-611 Retraction of anticipatory repudiation.** (1) Until the repudiating party's next performance is due he can retract his repudiation unless the aggrieved party has since the repudiation canceled or materially changes his position or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final.

(2) Retraction may be by any method which clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform, but must include any assurance, justifiably demanded under the provisions of this article (section 490:2-609).

(3) Retraction reinstates the repudiating party's rights under the contract with due excuse and allowances to the aggrieved party for any delay occasioned by the repudiation. [L 1965, c 208, ยง2-611; [HRS ยง490:2-611](/title-27/chapter-490/section-490-2-611/)]
