**PART 2\. ISSUE AND ACCEPTANCE OF PAYMENT ORDER**

**§490:4A-201 Security procedure.** "Security procedure" means a procedure established by agreement of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment order or communication amending or canceling a payment order is that of the customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the payment order or communication. A security procedure may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices. Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the customer is not by itself a security procedure. [L 1991, c 41, pt of §1]s of the owner to proceeds of the item are subject to rights of a collecting bank, such as those resulting from outstanding advances on the item and rights of recoupment or setoff. If an item is handled by banks for purposes of presentment, payment, collection, or return, the relevant provisions of this article apply even though action of the parties clearly establishes that a particular bank has purchased the item and is the owner of it.

(b) After an item has been indorsed with the words "pay any bank" or the like, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder until the item has been:

(1) Returned to the customer initiating collection; or

(2) Specially indorsed by a bank to a person who is not a bank. [L 1965, c 208, §4-201; [HRS §490:4-201](/title-27/chapter-490/section-490-4-201/); am L 1991, c 118, pt of §4]
