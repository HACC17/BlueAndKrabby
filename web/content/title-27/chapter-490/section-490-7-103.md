**ยง490:7-103 Relation of article to treaty or statute.** (a) This article is subject to any treaty or statute of the United States or regulatory statute of this State to the extent the treaty, statute, or regulatory statute is applicable.

(b) This article does not modify or repeal any law prescribing the form or content of a document of title or the services or facilities to be afforded by a bailee, or otherwise regulating a bailee's business in respects not specifically treated in this article. However, violation of such a law does not affect the status of a document of title that otherwise is within the definition of a document of title.

(c) This article modifies, limits, and supersedes the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (15 U.S.C. section 7001, et seq.) but does not modify, limit, or supersede section 101(c) of that Act (15 U.S.C. section 7001(c)) or authorize electronic delivery of any of the notices described in section 103(b) of that Act (15 U.S.C. section 7003(b)).

(d) To the extent there is a conflict between the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, chapter 489E, and this article, this article governs. [L 2004, c 163, pt of ยง1]
