**ยง490:2A-514 Waiver of lessee's objections.** (a) In rejecting goods, a lessee's failure to state a particular defect that is ascertainable by reasonable inspection precludes the lessee from relying on the defect to justify rejection or to establish default:

(1) If, stated seasonably, the lessor or the supplier could have cured it (section 490:2A-513); or

(2) Between merchants if the lessor or the supplier after rejection has made a request in writing for a full and final written statement of all defects on which the lessee proposes to rely.

(b) A lessee's failure to reserve rights when paying rent or other consideration against documents precludes recovery of the payment for defects apparent in the documents. [L 1991, c 40, pt of ยง1; am L 2004, c 163, ยง16]
