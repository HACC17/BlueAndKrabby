**ยง490:7-507 Warranties on negotiation or delivery of document of title.** If a person negotiates or delivers a document of title for value, otherwise than as a mere intermediary under section 490:7-508, unless otherwise agreed, the transferor, in addition to any warranty made in selling or leasing the goods, warrants to its immediate purchaser only that:

(1) The document is genuine;

(2) The transferor does not have knowledge of any fact that would impair the document's validity or worth; and

(3) The negotiation or delivery is rightful and fully effective with respect to the title to the document and the goods it represents. [L 2004, c 163, pt of ยง1]
