**ยง490:9-110 Security interests arising under article 2 or 2A.** A security interest arising under section 490:2-401, 490:2-505, 490:2-711(3), or 490:2A-508(e) is subject to this article. However, until the debtor obtains possession of the goods:

(1) The security interest is enforceable, even if section 490:9-203(b)(3) has not been satisfied;

(2) Filing is not required to perfect the security interest;

(3) The rights of the secured party after default by the debtor are governed by article 2 or 2A; and

(4) The security interest has priority over a conflicting security interest created by the debtor. [L 2000, c 241, pt of ยง1]
