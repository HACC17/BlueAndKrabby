**§490:2A-502 Notice after default.** Except as otherwise provided in this article or the lease agreement, the lessor or lessee in default under the lease contract is not entitled to notice of default or notice of enforcement from the other party to the lease agreement. [L 1991, c 40, pt of §1]rovisions of the immediately preceding section may on making and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of their price recover them from the seller if:

(a) In the case of goods bought for personal, family, or household purposes, the seller repudiates or fails to deliver as required by the contract; or

(b) In all cases, the seller becomes insolvent within ten days after receipt of the first installment on their price.

(2) The buyer's right to recover the goods under subsection (1)(a) vests upon acquisition of a special property, even if the seller had not then repudiated or failed to deliver.

(3) If the identification creating the buyer's special property has been made by the buyer, the buyer acquires the right to recover the goods only if they conform to the contract for sale. [L 1965, c 208, §2-502; [HRS §490:2-502](/title-27/chapter-490/section-490-2-502/); am L 2000, c 241, §14]
