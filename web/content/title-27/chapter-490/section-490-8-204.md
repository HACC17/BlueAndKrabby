**ยง490:8-204 Effect of issuer's restriction on transfer.** A restriction on transfer of a security imposed by the issuer, even if otherwise lawful, is ineffective against a person without knowledge of the restriction unless:

(1) The security is certificated and the restriction is noted conspicuously on the security certificate; or

(2) The security is uncertificated and the registered owner has been notified of the restriction. [L 1997, c 33, pt of ยง2]
