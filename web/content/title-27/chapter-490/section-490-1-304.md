**ยง490:1-304 Obligation of good faith.** Every contract or duty within this chapter imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement. [L 2004, c 162, pt of ยง1]

Case Notes

Where the court predicted that the Hawaii supreme court would interpret ยง490:1-203 (and this section, its successor) to preclude an independent cause of action for failure to perform or enforce a warranty in good faith, plaintiff's claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing dismissed. 459 F. Supp. 2d 1028.
