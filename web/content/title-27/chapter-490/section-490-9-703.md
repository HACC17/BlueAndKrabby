**ยง490:9-703 Security interest perfected before effective date.** (a) A security interest that is enforceable immediately before this article takes effect and would have priority over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time is a perfected security interest under this article if, when this article takes effect, the applicable requirements for enforceability and perfection under this article are satisfied without further action.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in section 490:9-705, if, immediately before this article takes effect, a security interest is enforceable and would have priority over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time, but the applicable requirements for enforceability or perfection under this article are not satisfied when this article takes effect, the security interest:

(1) Is a perfected security interest for one year after this article takes effect;

(2) Remains enforceable thereafter only if the security interest becomes enforceable under section 490:9-203 before the year expires; and

(3) Remains perfected thereafter only if the applicable requirements for perfection under this article are satisfied before the year expires. [L 2000, c 241, pt of ยง1]
