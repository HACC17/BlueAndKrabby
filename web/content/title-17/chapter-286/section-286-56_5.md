**§286-56.5 Special license plates for consul or official representative of foreign or territorial government.** Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, any consul or official representative of a foreign government or territory of the United States of America, duly licensed and holding an exequatur issued by the Department of State of the United States of America, may be furnished at no cost special license plates by the director of finance on such conditions as may be necessary on a vehicle used on official consular business, provided that upon application for special license plates a consul or official representative shall be given the option of using license plates issued by the consul's or official representative's government. Before such plates shall be considered as special license plates, they shall be registered and the appropriate fees paid to the county for the issuance. The special license plates shall be securely fastened to the vehicle in lieu of the regulation number plates; provided that the tag or emblem, issued each year, shall be affixed to the special license plates in the manner provided for in section 249-7\. Whenever the consul or official representative transfers or assigns the consul's or official representative's interest in or title in the vehicle to which the special license plates were issued, the consul or official representative shall immediately surrender the special license plates to the director of finance.
