In the case of an incompetent individual, the application shall be made by the individual having the custody or control of or maintaining the incompetent individual.

(b) Application for renewal of an identification card issued after November 1, 1998, for an individual eighty years of age or older may be done by mailing in a completed application and fee, if there is no change in name and citizenship status. The director shall adopt rules to allow for renewal by mail for individuals with physical or intellectual disabilities for whom application in person presents a serious burden.

(c) Every application for an identification card or duplicate of an identification card shall be made on a form developed by the director and furnished by the examiner of drivers, signed by the applicant, and signed by the applicant's parent or guardian if the applicant is under eighteen years of age.

(9) A digitized frontal photograph of the applicant's full face.

Each applicant shall present documentary evidence as required by the examiner of drivers of the applicant's age and identity, and the applicant shall swear or affirm that all information given is true and correct.

(d) The application also shall state whether the applicant has an advance health-care directive. If the applicant has an advance health-care directive, the identification card shall bear the designation "AHCD".

(f) The examiner of drivers shall maintain a suitable, indexed record of all applications.
