**[ยง286-307]** **Identification cards not to be altered; duties of holder; lost certificates.** (a) No individual, except agents of the examiner acting pursuant to the authority of law, shall alter, deface, or destroy any identification card. Except as specifically authorized by this section or the rules of the director, no cardholder shall loan or give the individual's identification card to any other individual, and no individual shall use the identification card of any other individual.

(b) Any individual whose identification card is stolen or otherwise lost, altered, defaced, or destroyed, may at any time apply for a duplicate identification card. The duplicate shall be issued by the examiner of drivers upon being satisfied as to the loss, alteration, defacing, or destruction. In the case of an altered or defaced identification card, the identification card, if available, shall be surrendered by the cardholder and canceled by the examiner.

(c) Any individual finding or coming into possession of the identification card of any other individual shall promptly return or deliver the same to the owner thereof, the examiner of drivers that issued it, or any law enforcement officer. [L 2012, c 310, pt of ยง2]
