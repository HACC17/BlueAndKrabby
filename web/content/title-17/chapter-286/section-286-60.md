**§286-60 Rules of procedure; costs; appeal.** The supreme court may prescribe rules of procedure relating to the appeals and hearings before the district courts. An appeal shall lie from the judgment or order of the district court to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602\. The rules shall provide for informal procedure and for minimizing expense and delay to litigants therein. The costs upon such appeal to the district court shall be $1, which may be waived by the court for good cause shown. No costs shall be chargeable against the county director of finance.
