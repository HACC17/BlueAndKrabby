**§286-122 Suspension of a license; surrender.** (a) Every person whose license or driving privilege has been suspended pursuant to this part or any traffic law or regulation of the State or any county, shall surrender the person's license to the examiner of drivers or the court, as is appropriate, which agency shall take custody of the license during the period of suspension.

(b) The examiner of drivers may suspend or revoke the license of any resident of this State or the privilege of a nonresident to drive a motor vehicle in this State upon receiving notice of the conviction of that person in another state, or within this State or another state by the federal government, of an offense therein which, if committed within the jurisdiction of this State, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of the driver's license or privilege.

The examiner of drivers may give the same effect to conduct of a resident in another state as is provided by the laws of this State had such conduct occurred in this State.

Any person whose license or driving privilege has been so suspended or revoked shall immediately return the person's license or permit to the examiner of drivers.

(c) Any resident or nonresident whose driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this State has been suspended or revoked as provided in this chapter shall not operate a motor vehicle in this State under a license or permit issued by any other jurisdiction or otherwise during such suspension or after such revocation until a new license is obtained when and as permitted under this chapter.
