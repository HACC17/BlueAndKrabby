**§286-59 Appeal; procedure.** Upon appeal, the district court shall hold a hearing de novo, and shall have power to enter such judgment or order as in its reasonable judgment may be warranted by all of the circumstances. In making the judgment or order, the court may waive defects or irregularities in the current or previous registrations which, in its opinion, have been satisfactorily explained on the part of the appellant, or may order registration of the vehicle subject to reasonable conditions to be then or thereafter, within a reasonable time fixed by the court, complied with by the appellant, upon noncompliance with which conditions the director of finance may cancel such registration. The conditions may include the furnishing of a bond in a reasonable amount, to be fixed by the court, to insure compliance with other conditions or to indemnify the director of finance and any other person in the event it is thereafter held or found that the registration was wrongful. Any certificate of registration issued subject to any such condition shall bear thereon an appropriate notation referring to the condition or the words "conditional registration". A copy of the court's order as to the conditional registration shall be served upon the director of finance and retained in the file relating to the registration, and shall constitute notice to the world of the condition therein stated, provided the certificate of registration contains a notation of conditional registration as hereinabove provided. [L 1951, c 237, §2; RL 1955, §160-17; [HRS §286-59](/title-17/chapter-286/section-286-59/); am L 1970, c 188, §39]

Revision Note

"Director of finance" substituted for "treasurer" to conform to county charters.
