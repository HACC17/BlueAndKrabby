(B) A judgment on a verdict or a finding of guilty, or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, for an offense that is comparable to section 291-4, 291-4.4, or 291-7 as those sections were in effect on December 31, 2001, or section 291E-61 or 707-702.5; or

After the period of revocation is complete, the person may apply for and the examiner of drivers may grant to the person a new driver's license.

(g) Any person sentenced under this section may be ordered to reimburse the county for the cost of any blood or urine tests conducted pursuant to section 291E-11\.

Case Notes

An appellate court's remand for entry of judgment of conviction and resentencing for a lesser-included offense must be based on a jurisdictionally valid lesser-included charge; where defendant's charge under this section did not adequately allege the lesser-included offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant as a first offender under §291E-61 because the charge failed to allege an essential element, specifically, the attendant circumstance that defendant operated a vehicle on a public road, way, street, or highway, the appellate court did not err in vacating and remanding circuit court case. 126 H. 475, 273 P.3d 1161 (2012).

Where, under §701-114(1)(a), proof of each element of an offense is required for a conviction, and the term "habitual" or "habitual operator" in the indictment did not convey the narrow definition that the person charged with habitually operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant had to have three or more convictions within the previous ten years, the phrase "habitual operator" did not provide adequate notice to defendant what the State was required to prove as an element of the offense; thus, defendant's conviction vacated. 128 H. 132 (App.), 284 P.3d 905 (2012).
