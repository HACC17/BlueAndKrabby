Case Notes

The completion of certain administrative driver's license revocation office forms by defendant and subsequent transmittal of the forms by a civilian police officer for the Navy to the office did not violate the Posse Comitatus Act as (1) the enforcement of Hawaii state law against military personnel on a military base does not infringe on civil authority, and (2) a primary purpose for the completion and transmittal was established; thus, suspension of defendant's license affirmed. 110 H. 172, 130 P.3d 1037.
