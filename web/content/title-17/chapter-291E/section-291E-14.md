**[ยง291E-14] Consent of person incapable of refusal not withdrawn.** The consent of a person deemed to have given the person's consent pursuant to section 291E-11 shall not be withdrawn by reason of the person's being dead, unconscious, or in any other condition that renders the person incapable of consenting to examination, and the test may be given. In such event, a test of the person's blood or urine shall be administered. [L 2000, c 189, pt of ยง23]
