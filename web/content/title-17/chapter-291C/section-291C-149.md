**[ยง291C-149] Bicycle racing.** (a) Bicycle racing on the highways is prohibited except as authorized in this section.

(b) Bicycle racing on a highway shall not be unlawful when a racing event has been approved by local authorities for any highway under their respective jurisdictions or for state highways, by the director of transportation. The director may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 necessary for the purposes of this chapter. Approval of bicycle highway racing events shall be granted only under conditions which assure reasonable safety for all race participants, spectators and other highway users, and which prevent unreasonable interference with traffic flow which would seriously inconvenience other highway users.

(c) By agreement with the local authority, participants in an approved bicycle highway racing event may be exempted from compliance with any traffic laws otherwise applicable thereto, provided that traffic control is adequate to assure the safety of all highway users. [L 1984, c 273, ยง16]
