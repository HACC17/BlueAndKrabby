The foregoing requirements shall apply when:

(1) A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train;

(2) A crossing gate is lowered or when a human flagperson gives or continues to give a signal of the approach or passage of a train;

(3) A railroad train approaching within approximately fifteen hundred feet of the highway crossing emits a signal audible from that distance and the railroad train, by reason of its speed or nearness to the crossing, is an immediate hazard;

(4) An approaching railroad train is approximately within fifteen hundred feet of the crossing and is plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to the crossing.
