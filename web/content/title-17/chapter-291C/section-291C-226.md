**[ยง291C-226] Liability for rental or U-drive vehicle.** Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, if the registered owner of record is the lessor of a rental or U-drive motor vehicle, as defined in section 286-2 pursuant to a written lease agreement, the lessee at the time of the violation shall be responsible for the summons or citation. However, the lessor shall be responsible for the summons or citation if the lessor does not provide the court, having jurisdiction over the summons or citation, with the name and address of the lessee within forty-five days after a notice containing the date, time, and location of the violation and the license number of the vehicle is sent to lessor; provided further that the administrative judge of the court having jurisdiction over the summons or citation may waive the requirement of providing the name and address of the lessee and impose on the lessor an administrative fee of $50 per citation.
