**ยง291C-33 Pedestrian-control signals.** Whenever special pedestrian-control signals, exhibiting the words "Walk" or "Don't Walk" or the symbols of a walking person or an upraised palm are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:

(1) Walk or Walking Person. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.

(2) Don't Walk or Upraised Palm. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of such signal, whether flashing or steady, but any pedestrian who has partially completed the pedestrian's crossing on the Walk or Walking Person signal shall complete the crossing to a sidewalk or safety island while the Don't Walk or Upraised Palm signal is showing.
