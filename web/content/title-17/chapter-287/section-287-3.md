Case Notes

Based on the clear language of subsection (a) and §291-3.3(b), and because §291-3.3(b) does not describe a "moving violation" which arises from the "operation of a motor vehicle", the district court disregarded the statutory requirements and abused its discretion in determining that a violation of §291-3.3(b) was properly included as part of defendant's traffic abstract. 123 H. 293 (App.), 233 P.3d 713 (2010).
