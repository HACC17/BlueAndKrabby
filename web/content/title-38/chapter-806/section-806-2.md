**§806-2 Inapplicable to district courts.** Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter that the same applies to courts of record, such provision shall not, without more, apply to district courts. [L 1971, c 144, §31B; [HRS §711-2](/title-37/chapter-711/section-711-2/); ren L 1972, c 9, pt of §1]

Case Notes

As the plain language of this section limits the application of the criminal procedure provisions of this chapter to the circuit courts, the appellate court erred by extending the application of §806-28 to the district courts. 127 H. 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012).
