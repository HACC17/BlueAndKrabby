(b) The attorney general may institute proceedings under this section. In any action brought by the State under this section, the court shall proceed as soon as practicable to the hearing and determination thereof. Pending final determination thereof, the court may at any time enter such restraining orders or prohibitions, or take such other actions, including the acceptance of satisfactory performance bonds, as it shall deem proper.

(c) Any person injured in the person's business or property by reason of a violation of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate court and shall recover the damages the person sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.

(d) A final judgment or decree rendered in favor of the State in any criminal proceeding brought by the State under this chapter shall estop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of the criminal offense in any subsequent civil proceeding brought by the State.
