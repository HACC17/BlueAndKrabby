**ยง853-2 Plea of guilty or nolo contendere; procedure.** Upon motion made before sentence by the defendant, the prosecutor, or on its own motion, the court will either proceed in accordance with section 853-1, or deny the motion and accept the defendant's plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or allow the defendant to withdraw the defendant's plea of guilty or nolo contendere only for good cause. [L 1976, c 154, pt of ยง2; am L 1983, c 290, ยง3; gen ch 1985]

Case Notes

Denial of withdrawal of guilty plea is not abuse of discretion. (Earlier program.) 58 H. 304, 568 P.2d 1194 (1977).
