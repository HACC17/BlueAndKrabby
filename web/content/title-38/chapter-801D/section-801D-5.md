**[ยง801D-5]** **Responsibility for rights and services.** (a) Each county is responsible for the enforcement of rights under section 801D-4\. The courts shall fashion all decisions and orders to enhance the recognition of these rights and the provision of these services, to the extent that they will not conflict with the constitutional rights of the defendant.

(b) Neither the failure of any state or county officer or employee to carry out the requirements of this section nor compliance with it shall subject the state or county officer or employee to liability in any civil action. However, such failure may provide a basis for such disciplinary action as may be deemed appropriate by competent authority. [L 1988, c 261, pt of ยง1]
