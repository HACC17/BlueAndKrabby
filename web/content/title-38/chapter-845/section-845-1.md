**[ยง845-1] Findings and purpose.** The legislature finds that a substantial and disproportionate amount of serious crime is committed against the people by a relatively small number of multiple and repeat felony offenders, commonly known as career criminals. In enacting this chapter, the legislature intends to support increased efforts by prosecuting attorneys' offices to prosecute career criminals through organizational and operational techniques that have been proven effective in selected counties in other states.
