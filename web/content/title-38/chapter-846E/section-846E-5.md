Upon receipt of the verification form:

(1) The covered offender shall sign the verification form and state that the covered offender still resides at the address last reported to the attorney general and that no other registration information has changed or shall provide the new information; and

(3) No place of residence; or

(4) A permanent residence address, to which the United States Postal Service will not deliver mail, and has no registered post office box,

during the first week of the months of January, April, July, and October of every year, the covered offender shall report to the chief of police where the covered offender resides, or to such other department or agency that may be designated by the attorney general in rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91 for purposes of administration of this section, and shall review the existing information in the registry that is within the covered offender's knowledge, correct any information that has changed or is inaccurate, and provide any new information that may be required.

(c) The periodic verification provisions of this section shall not apply to covered offenders who are incarcerated or have registered with a designated law enforcement agency after establishing residence in another state. [L 1997, c 316, pt of §2; am L 2005, c 45, §7; am L 2013, c 64, §7]

Note

The 2013 amendment applies to any acts committed prior to, on, or after April 30, 2013\. L 2013, c 64, §11.

Case Notes

As the registration requirements of chapter 846E do not interfere with any of a sex offender's protected liberty interests, the protections of procedural due process are not triggered. 97 H. 285, 36 P.3d 1255 (2001).
