Case Notes

Since this section provides chief of police or designee with independent authority and discretion to admit persons charged with misdemeanor offenses to bail in accordance with §804-9, senior judge of family court lacked authority to issue a bail schedule divesting police of that authority and discretion. 75 H. 357, 861 P.2d 1205 (1993).

See 18 H. 500 (1907).
