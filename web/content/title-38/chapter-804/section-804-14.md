Case Notes

Where principal was surrendered, surety entitled to return of bond whether principal was actually surrendered by surety or police. 81 H. 324, 916 P.2d 1225 (1996).

Because §804-51 governs situations in which judgment of forfeiture has been entered, and such a judgment was entered against petitioner, §804-51 and not this section applied to recovery of the bail bond by petitioner. 131 H. 9, 313 P.3d 698 (2013).

Pursuant to §804-51, once the court forfeits a bail bond, this section is limited by the thirty-day search period contained within §804-51\. 131 H. 9, 313 P.3d 698 (2013).
