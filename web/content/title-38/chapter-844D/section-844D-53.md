**[ยง844D-53] Analysis of forensic identification profiles.** A biological sample obtained from a suspect in a criminal investigation for the commission of any crime may be analyzed for forensic identification profiles, including DNA profiles, by any private or law enforcement crime laboratory accredited by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board or any certifying body approved by the Director of the FBI and then compared by the department, in and between, as many cases and investigations as necessary, and searched against the forensic identification profiles, including DNA profiles, stored in the files of the state DNA database or data bank identification program or any available data banks or databases as part of the state DNA database and data bank identification program. The law enforcement investigating agency submitting a specimen, sample, or print impression to the department or law enforcement crime laboratory pursuant to this section shall inform the department within two years whether the person remains a suspect in a criminal investigation. Upon written notification from a law enforcement agency that a person is no longer a suspect in a criminal investigation, the department shall remove the suspect sample from its data bank files. However, any identification, warrant, arrest, or prosecution based upon a data bank or database match shall not be invalidated or dismissed due to a failure to purge or a delay in purging records.
