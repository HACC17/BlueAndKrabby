(b) A person requesting expungement of their DNA specimen, sample, and profile:

(1) May make a written request to have the person's specimen and sample destroyed and searchable database profile expunged from the state DNA database and data bank identification program if the underlying conviction or disposition serving as the basis for including the DNA profile has been reversed and the case dismissed; and
