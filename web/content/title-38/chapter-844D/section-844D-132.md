**[ยง844D-132] Procedure after testing results are obtained.** (a) If the results of the post-conviction DNA testing are favorable to the defendant, the court shall conduct a hearing pursuant to applicable law or court rule governing post-conviction proceedings, notwithstanding any law or court rule that would otherwise bar such a hearing as untimely or procedurally defective, and thereafter make such orders as are necessary for disposition of those proceedings. If the results of the DNA analysis are not favorable to the defendant, the court shall give notice of the results to probation or parole authorities, as appropriate.

(b) Records reflecting the results of DNA analysis performed pursuant to this section, including the underlying data and laboratory notes, shall not be subject to disclosure pursuant to chapter 92F except to the extent of a conclusion that a particular person was, or was not, the source of the biological evidence analyzed.

(c) In any case as to which a motion is filed under this section, the prosecuting attorney shall give notice to the victim or surviving immediate family members of a homicide victim of the filing of the motion, any hearing that is held as a result, and its disposition. For purposes of this subsection, "victim" and "surviving immediate family members" have the same meaning as in section 801D-2.

(d) The court shall make appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its disposition of a motion made pursuant to this section, regardless of whether a hearing was held. [L 2005, c 112, pt of ยง1]
