Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing post-conviction relief, if DNA test results are obtained under testing conducted upon consent of the parties which are favorable to the defendant, the defendant may file, and the court shall adjudicate, a motion for post-conviction relief under the provisions of this part, based on the DNA test results.
