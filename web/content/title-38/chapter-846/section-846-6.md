**ยง846-6 Systematic audit.** All criminal justice agencies shall institute a process of data collection, entry, storage, and systematic audit of criminal history record information that will minimize the possibility of recording and storing inaccurate information. Any criminal justice agency which finds that it has reported inaccurate information of a material nature shall forthwith notify all criminal justice agencies known to have received such information. All criminal justice agencies shall:

(1) Maintain for a minimum period of one year a listing of the individuals or agencies both in and outside of the State to which criminal history record information was released, a record of what information was released, and the date such information was released;

(2) Establish a delinquent disposition monitoring system; and

(3) Verify all record entries for accuracy and completeness. [L 1979, c 129, pt of ยง2]
