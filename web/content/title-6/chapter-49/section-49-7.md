**ยง49-7 CUSIP numbers.** The governing body issuing revenue bonds pursuant to this chapter, in its discretion, may provide that CUSIP identification numbers shall be imprinted on the revenue bonds. In the event such numbers are imprinted on any revenue bonds (1) no CUSIP number shall constitute a part of the contract evidenced by the particular revenue bond upon which it is imprinted and (2) no liability shall attach to the county, or any officer or agent thereof, including any fiscal agent, paying agent, or registrar for the bonds, by reason of the numbers or any use made thereof, and including any use thereof made by the county, any officer or any agent, or by reason of any inaccuracy, error, or omission with respect thereto or in that use. The governing body in its discretion may require that all cost of obtaining and imprinting the numbers shall be paid by the purchaser of the bonds. For the purposes of this section the term "CUSIP identification numbers" means the numbering system adopted by the Committee for Uniform Security Identification Procedures formed by the Securities Industry Association.
