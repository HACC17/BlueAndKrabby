**ยง47C-3 Supplemental determination.** Whenever the county proposes to issue bonds, the director of finance shall prepare a supplemental summary of the indebtedness of the county setting forth therein such information and findings as of a date within thirty days of the delivery of such bonds as will bring up to date and make current the most recent summary prepared in accordance with the provisions of section 47C-2\. The director of finance shall also prepare and attach to such supplemental summary such supporting schedules as may be required to set forth in detail the variations and changes from the summary prepared in accordance with section 47C-2, including such legal and financial findings as will justify any changes in the itemizations set forth in such previous summary pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (4) of section 47C-2\. If all the bonds proposed to be issued may be excluded when determining the funded debt of the county for the purposes of section 13 of article VII of the constitution by reason of the provisions of clauses 2 or 4 of that section, the supplemental summary and supporting schedules may be limited to such bonds and findings as are necessary to justify such exclusion under such clauses.

In the event proceeds of the bonds proposed to be issued are to be applied to the retirement in the then fiscal year of outstanding bonds, including notes issued in anticipation of the issuance of the bonds proposed to be issued, for the purpose of applying the provisions of clause 1 of section 13 of article VII of the constitution to the bonds to be retired, that amount of such proceeds to be so applied may be considered and treated as moneys irrevocably set aside for the payment of such bonds.
