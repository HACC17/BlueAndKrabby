**ยง58-3 County arborist advisory committees; powers and duties.** For the purposes of this chapter, the county committees shall have the following powers and duties in addition to those delegated by the respective county councils:

(1) To research, prepare, and recommend to the county council exceptional trees to be protected by county ordinance or regulation.

(2) To advise property owners relative to the preservation and enhancement of exceptional trees.

(3) To recommend to the county council appropriate protective ordinances, regulations, and procedures.

(4) To review all actions deemed by the county council to endanger exceptional trees.

For the purposes of this section, "exceptional trees" means a tree or stand or grove of trees with historic or cultural value, or which by reason of its age, rarity, location, size, esthetic quality, or endemic status has been designated by the county committee as worthy of preservation. The term "exceptional trees" does not apply to trees planted for commercial forestry operations in each county within the State. Exceptional trees may be designated generally by biotaxy or individually by location or class. [L 1975, c 105, pt of ยง2; am L 1977, c 69, ยง1]
