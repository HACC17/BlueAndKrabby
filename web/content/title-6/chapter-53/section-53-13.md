**ยง53-13 New constructions by agency.** The redevelopment agency may not erect new structures upon any of its property (except structures to be held and used by the government for public purposes), but, if it will promote the realization of the redevelopment plan, it may grade, drain, construct streets, and install necessary utilities such as sewers, water, and lights.
