**ยง46-112 Tax on leased redevelopment property.** Whenever property in the tax increment district has been redeveloped and thereafter is leased by the county or redevelopment agency to any person or whenever the county or agency leases real property in any tax increment district to any person for redevelopment, the property shall be assessed and taxed in the same manner as privately owned property, and the lease or contract shall provide that the lessee shall pay taxes upon the assessed value of the entire property and not merely the assessed value of the lessee's leasehold interest. [L 1985, c 267, pt of ยง1]
