**ยง46-71.5 Indemnification of county agencies**. (a) To receive county aid, assistance, support, benefits, services, and interests in or rights to use county property, a state agency may agree in writing to an indemnity provision by which the State agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless a county agency, its officers, agents, and employees when:

(1) The governor approves the State's proposed indemnification; and

(2) The comptroller, pursuant to section 41D-8.5, has obtained an insurance policy or policies in an amount sufficient to cover the liability of the State that reasonably may be anticipated to arise under the indemnity provision, or has determined that it is not in the best interest of the State to obtain insurance.

(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), the governor may delegate to the superintendent of education or the deputy superintendent if so designated by the superintendent of education the authority to agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless a county agency, its officers, agents, and employees when:

(1) The use of the county property will be for a public school purpose or a public school function;

(2) The governor approves, in writing, the indemnity provision to be used by the superintendent of education or the deputy superintendent if so designated by the superintendent of education which provision, upon approval, may serve as approval under this paragraph for all public school purposes or functions on county properties for the remainder of that same school year; and

(3) The comptroller, pursuant to section 41D-8.5, has obtained an insurance policy or policies in an amount sufficient to cover the liability of the State that reasonably may be anticipated to arise under the indemnity provision, or has determined that it is not in the best interest of the State to obtain insurance.

(c) An indemnity provision not in strict compliance with this section shall not give rise to a claim against the State under chapter 661 or otherwise waive the State's sovereign immunity. [L 2007, c 152, ยง10; am L 2010, c 145, ยง2]
