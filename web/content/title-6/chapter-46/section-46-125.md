**[ยง46-125] Periodic review; termination of agreement.** (a) If, as a result of a periodic review, the designated agency finds and determines that the principal has committed a material breach of the terms or conditions of the agreement, the designated agency shall serve notice in writing, within a reasonable time period after the periodic review, upon the principal setting forth with reasonable particularity the nature of the breach and the evidence supporting the finding and determination, and providing the principal a reasonable time period in which to cure such material breach.

(b) If the principal fails to cure the material breach within the time period given, then the county unilaterally may terminate or modify the agreement; provided that the designated agency has first given the principal the opportunity, (1) to rebut the finding and determination; or (2) to consent to amend the agreement to meet the concerns of the designated agency with respect to the finding and determination.
