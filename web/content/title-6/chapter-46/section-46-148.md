**[ยง46-148] Transitions.** Any county requiring impact fees or imposing development exactions, in order to fund public facilities, shall incorporate fee requirements into their broader system of development and land use regulations in such a manner that developments, either collectively or individually, are not required to pay or otherwise contribute more than a proportionate share of public facility capital improvements. Development contributions or payments made under a development agreement, pursuant to section 46-123, are exempted from this requirement. [L 1992, c 282, pt of ยง2]
