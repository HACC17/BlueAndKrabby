**ยง46-107 Tax increment bond anticipation notes.** Whenever the county has authorized the issuance of tax increment bonds under this part, tax increment bond anticipation notes of the county may be issued in anticipation of the issuance of such bonds and of the receipt of the proceeds of sale thereof, for the purposes for which such bonds have been authorized. All tax increment bond anticipation notes shall be authorized by the county, and the maximum principal amount of such notes shall not exceed the authorized principal amount of the bonds. The notes shall be payable solely from and secured solely by the proceeds of sale of the tax increment bonds in anticipation of which the notes are issued and the moneys in the tax increment fund from which would be payable and by which would be secured such bonds; provided that to the extent that the principal of the notes shall be paid from moneys other than the proceeds of sale of such bonds, the maximum amount of bonds authorized in anticipation of which the notes are issued shall be reduced by the amount of notes paid in such manner. The authorization, issuance, and details of such notes shall be governed by this part with respect to tax increment bonds insofar as the same may be applicable; provided that each note, together with renewals and extensions thereof, or refundings thereof by other notes issued under this section, shall mature within five years from the date of the original note.
