**[ยง46-124] Negotiating development agreements.** The mayor or the designated agency appointed to administer development agreements may make such arrangements as may be necessary or proper to enter into development agreements, including negotiating and drafting individual development agreements; provided that the county has adopted an ordinance pursuant to section 46-123.

The final draft of each individual development agreement shall be presented to the county legislative body for approval or modification prior to execution. To be binding on the county, a development agreement must be approved by the county legislative body and executed by the mayor on behalf of the county. County legislative approval shall be by resolution adopted by a majority of the membership of the county legislative body. [L 1985, c 48, pt of ยง1]
