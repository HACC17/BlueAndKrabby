**[ยง46-4.2] Nonsignificant zoning changes.** Each county may provide by ordinance that nonsignificant changes to zoning boundaries may be made administratively by the designated county agency with responsibility over zoning matters, provided that "nonsignificant changes" shall mean a zoning change which does not result in an increase or decrease in any zoning designation affecting more than five per cent or one acre of any parcel of property, whichever is less, and which is in compliance with the general plan and development plan designation for the property. [L 1977, c 74, ยง3]
