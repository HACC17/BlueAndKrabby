(b) Upon demand by the department of Hawaiian home lands, each county shall accept the license or dedication and ownership of any and all sewer transmission lines and other sewerage facilities servicing Hawaiian home lands and that are not subject to subsection (a), as may be identified by the department of Hawaiian home lands; provided that:

(2) Sewer transmission lines and other sewerage facilities completed after [July 7, 2014,] shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and county environmental, design, and construction requirements prior to acceptance by a county.
