**§46-10 County bands; travel.** The county council or city council of any county having a county band may authorize its band to travel to any other county or abroad for the purpose of creating goodwill. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, county bands are authorized to receive donations from private persons or entities for travel expenses, or to have said expenses underwritten by private persons or entities, or the band itself may raise funds by engaging in fund-raising activities, provided that such fund-raising activities shall be done after regular working hours, and provided further that admission fees may be charged wherever or whenever the band is performing.
