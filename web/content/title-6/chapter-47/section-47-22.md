**ยง47-22 Garnishee to satisfy judgment.** If final judgment is rendered against defendant in the action, garnishee shall immediately thereafter draw, sign, and deliver to the plaintiff or plaintiffs a warrant or warrants for the sum held by the garnishee in obedience to service of process; and if the sum does not equal the amount of the final judgment, then the drawing, signing, and delivery of the warrants shall continue to be made from time to time as funds become available until the final judgment, with interest, is fully paid. All warrants so drawn, signed, and delivered shall be charged against the defendant. [L 1989, c 80, pt of ยง2]
