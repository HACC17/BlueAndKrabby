**ยง47-41 Request for replacement or payment.** Any party claiming ownership of a bond issued by a county or any interest coupon appertaining to any bond of that county and which bond, coupon, or both, as the case may be, has been lost, stolen, destroyed, wholly or in part, or so defaced as to impair its value, may file with the director of finance of that county a request for replacement or payment of the bond, coupon or both, as the case may be. The request shall be in the form of an affidavit describing the bond, coupon, or both, as the case may be, and explaining the circumstances under which the bond, coupon, or both, as the case may be, was lost, stolen, destroyed or defaced. The affidavit shall be presented with such evidence as the director of finance may require to establish the ownership of the bond, coupon, or both. [L 1989, c 80, pt of ยง2]
