**§48E-12 Validity of special purpose revenue bonds.** The special purpose revenue bonds bearing the signature or facsimile signature of officers in office on the date of the signing thereof shall be valid and sufficient for all purposes, notwithstanding that before the delivery thereof and payment therefor any or all the persons whose signatures appear thereon shall have ceased to be officers of the county issuing the bonds. The validity of the special purpose revenue bonds shall not be dependent on nor affected by the validity or regularity of any proceedings relating to the pollution control project for which the special purpose revenue bonds are issued. The ordinance authorizing the special purpose revenue bonds may provide that the special purpose revenue bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to this chapter, which recital shall be conclusive evidence of their validity and of the regularity of their issuance. [L 1983, c 237, pt of §2]
