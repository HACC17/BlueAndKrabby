**[ยง56-2 Methods of financing.]** The council of any county may finance the acquisition, improvement or construction of off-street parking facilities in the same manner as is permissible for any other type of public improvement so long as the applicable statutes and ordinances governing the particular method or methods of financing chosen are complied with; provided that if the council decides to finance the acquisition, improvement or construction of any off-street parking facility in whole or in part by the creation of a public off-street parking district in accordance with the county's improvement by assessments ordinance, land owned by or in possession of the United States or any of its agencies or the State or any of its political subdivisions or agencies which cannot lawfully be made subject to assessments against the land within a public off-street parking district, or any other land which in the judgment of the council will not be benefited by the acquisition, improvement or construction of the public off-street parking facility shall not be included within the district; and provided further that land to be acquired for public off-street parking facilities shall not be assessed.
