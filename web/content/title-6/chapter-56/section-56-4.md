**[ยง56-4 Leasing of space above or below off-street parking facilities.]** Whenever the council decides that the space above or below any proposed or existing public off-street parking facility is not needed for additional parking and that it would be in the public interest it may require the finance director to lease the right to occupy and use such space for uses other than off-street parking together with the right to use and occupy such space within the parking facility as may be necessary for the purposes of access to and support of structures occupying the space above or below such parking facility.
