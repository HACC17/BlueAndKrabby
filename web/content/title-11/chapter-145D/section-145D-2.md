(b) A charitable, religious, or nonprofit organization which in good faith receives food, apparently fit for human consumption, and distributes it to needy persons at no charge, shall not be liable for any civil damages or criminal penalties resulting from the condition of the food unless an injury or illness results from its gross negligence, or wanton acts or omissions.
