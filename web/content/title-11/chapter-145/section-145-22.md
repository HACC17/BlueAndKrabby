If the commodity being offered for sale has a value of $300 or more, the seller shall also provide the buyer with a photocopy of the identification card or license of the seller.

One of the copies of the certificate shall be presented upon request to a state or county law enforcement officer or other officer, employee, or any other person authorized and designated by the board of agriculture to investigate and enforce this chapter and all rules adopted by the department pursuant thereto.
