(2) An inventory of agricultural infrastructure that will be abandoned by sugar and pineapple industries such as irrigation systems, drainage systems, processing facilities, and other accessory facilities;

(3) An analysis of imported agricultural products and the potential for increasing local production to replace imported products in a manner that complements existing local producers and increases Hawaii's agricultural self-sufficiency;

(4) Alternatives in the establishment of sound financial programs to promote the development of diversified agriculture;

(5) Feasible strategies for the promotion, marketing, and distribution of Hawaii agricultural products in local, national, and international markets;

(6) Programs to promote and facilitate the absorbing of displaced agricultural workers into alternative agricultural enterprises;

(7) Strategies to insure the provision of adequate air and surface transportation services and supporting facilities to support the agricultural industry in meeting local, national, and international market needs;

(8) Proposals to improve the gathering of data and the timely presentation of information on market demands and trends that can be used to plan future harvests and production; and

(9) Strategies for federal and state legislative actions that will promote the development and enhancement of Hawaii's agricultural industries.
