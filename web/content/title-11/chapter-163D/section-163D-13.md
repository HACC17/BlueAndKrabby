Each fund shall be designated "project facility revenue bond special fund" and shall bear additional designation as the corporation deems appropriate to properly identify the fund.

(b) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, including section [163D-17], all revenues, income, and receipts derived from the project facility for which the revenue bonds are issued shall be paid into the project facility revenue bond fund established for that project facility and applied as provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds.
