**[ยง150A-15] Failure to obey summons.** Any person who fails to appear at the place and time specified in the citation and summons issued to that person by the inspector upon the person's citation for violation of the quarantine laws or rules shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, on conviction, fined not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

If any person fails to comply with a citation and summons issued to the person, the inspector shall cause a complaint to be entered against the person and secure the issuance of a warrant for that person's arrest.

When a complaint is made to any prosecuting officer of the violation of any quarantine law or any rule promulgated thereunder, the inspector who issued the complaint and summons shall subscribe to it under oath. [L 1985, c 133, ยง10; gen ch 1985]
