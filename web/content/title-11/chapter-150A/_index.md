"SECTION 13.  (a)  Between July 1, 2010, and September 30, 2010, the department of agriculture shall adopt new or amend existing rules to impose or increase the fees authorized to be charged under chapter 150A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, without regard to the public notice and public hearing requirements of section 91-3, Hawaii Revised Statutes, the small business impact review requirements of chapter 201M, Hawaii Revised Statutes, or the limit on fee increases under section 92-28, Hawaii Revised Statutes.  The department shall set the fees at amounts intended to generate, together with the inspection, quarantine, and eradication service fee, sufficient revenues to pay the operation and maintenance costs of implementing the agriculture inspection and biosecurity programs of chapter 150A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and the central services and departmental administrative expense assessments of section 36-27 and section 36-30, Hawaii Revised Statutes.

(b)  If, by September 30, 2010, the department of agriculture has not complied with subsection (a), then the fee charged for each inspection or certification conducted under authority of chapter 150A shall be as follows, effective October 1, 2010:

(1) A fee for inspection, safeguarding, witnessing departure, witnessing treatment, or certification requiring the services of personnel beyond regular work hours, including pre-shift, post-shift, holidays, or days off shall be $50 plus mileage reimbursement, and an additional fee shall be assessed, which shall include applicable charges for overtime wages, fixed charges for personnel services, and meals;

(2) A fee for any inspection during regular work hours conducted away from the port or department office that is conducted pursuant to requirements for export, certification, inter-island or intra-island movement, or disposition other than release at a port of arrival, such as witnessing departure, destruction, or treatment, shall be $50 per hour plus mileage reimbursement;

(3) An annual fee for nursery certification shall be $100;

(4) A fee for follow-up inspections required to correct deficiencies found in a certification inspection or inspections to remedy out-of-state rejections shall be $50 per hour plus mileage reimbursement;

(5) A fee for treatment or destruction of infested commodities performed by the department's plant quarantine branch shall be $50 per parcel;

(6) A fee for the use of a quarantine house operated by the department's plant quarantine branch shall be $50 per room per month; and

Case Notes

While this chapter and the board's microorganism import rules may have vested the board with exclusive authority to approve marine biotechnology firm's proposal to import and grow genetically engineered algae at the State's research and technology park, as the demonstration project constituted an action that proposed the use of state land, §343-5 plainly and unambiguously required the preparation of an environmental assessment before the board could approve firm's application. 118 H. 247 (App.), 188 P.3d 761.
