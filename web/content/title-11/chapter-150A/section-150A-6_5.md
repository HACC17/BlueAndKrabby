**ยง150A-6.5 Animals; prohibition against possession, etc.; exception.** No person shall possess, propagate, sell, transfer, or harbor any animal included on the list of prohibited animals maintained by the board, except upon a determination that the species:

(1) Was initially permitted entry and later prohibited entry into the State; or

(2) Was continually prohibited but unlawfully introduced and is currently established in the State; and

(3) Is not significantly harmful to agriculture, horticulture, or animal or public health, and the environment.

Under the circumstances described in this [section], the board may permit possession of the individual animal through its registration with the department while still prohibiting the same species of animal from importation, propagation, transfer, and sale. [L 2000, c 211, pt of ยง1]
