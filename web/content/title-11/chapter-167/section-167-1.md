**[ยง167-1] Findings and declaration of necessity.** It is important to the welfare of the people of Hawaii that agricultural production be developed as fully as possible. It is further found that water presently tapped for irrigation is inadequate for the fullest development of the economy of the State. It is therefore hereby declared that additional water and water facilities are necessary for the development of agriculture in the State.

It is the intent of the legislature that no project under this chapter shall be organized in the city and county of Honolulu or other counties without the board of agriculture first consulting the board of water supply of the city and county of Honolulu or the water board or department of each county.
