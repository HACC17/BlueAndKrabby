**[ยง167-21] Repayment of certain state advances.** (a) Whenever under legislative authorization, past, present or future, general obligation bonds of the State are issued or the proceeds of general obligation bonds of the State are used, by way of advancement, for the establishment and construction of any specific project under the jurisdiction of the board of agriculture in its irrigation water program, the board may repay the same to the director of finance, upon the expiration of ten years from the time of initial irrigation service to the project, which ten-year term shall be the development period, as repayment on account of the advancement. Such payments shall be made over the period of the next succeeding forty years after the termination of the development period, the total of which payments shall be sufficient to reimburse the State for redemption of the bonds together with interest paid by the State in respect of the same.

(b) The foregoing method of repayment of advances shall be effective for each phase of any multiphase project, the amortization period for the advancement commencing ten years from the time that facilities to provide irrigation service for each new project phase are put into operation.
