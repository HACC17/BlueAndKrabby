The purpose of the program is to develop and support good agricultural practices for Hawaii farms growing agricultural food products.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the Hawaii good agricultural practices program shall:

(1) Develop science- and risk-based good agricultural practices that reasonably reduce the potential for on-farm food-borne illness and include, as appropriate, specific considerations and methodologies for farm sizes, practices, techniques, materials, and crops;

(2) Develop and implement programs to educate and train Hawaii farmers to learn and implement good agricultural practices in a cost-effective and efficient manner;

(3) Provide procedures for the voluntary verification of on-farm implementation of good agricultural practices and the subsequent issuance of state compliance certification; and

(4) Develop a consumer information program for publication and broadcast to teach home practices for the treatment and handling of fresh and processed agricultural food products.

(c) The department shall consult as necessary with the department of health, the University of Hawaii college of tropical agriculture and human resources, and other state and federal agencies to develop and implement the Hawaii good agricultural practices program.

(d) The department may adopt rules under chapter 91 to facilitate the implementation of this section. [L 2015, c 153, ยง2]
