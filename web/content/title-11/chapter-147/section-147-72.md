**§147-72 Sale of bad eggs.** No person shall sell, or offer to sell, or expose for sale, any eggs unfit for human food unless they are broken in shell and then denatured so that they cannot be used for human food. For the purposes of this part an egg is deemed unfit for human food if it is addled or moldy, if it contains a black spot, black rot, white rot, or blood ring; if it has an adherent yolk or a bloody or green white (albumen), or if it consists in whole or in part of a filthy, decomposed or putrid substance.
