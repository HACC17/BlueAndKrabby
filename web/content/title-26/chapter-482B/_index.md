Case Notes

By alleging an induced breach of a confidentiality agreement or a non-disclosure agreement, plaintiff had also alleged that defendants improperly acquired trade secret information; those claims were sufficiently related to plaintiff's allegations of trade secret misappropriation to warrant preemption under this chapter; defendants' motion to dismiss granted. 780 F. Supp. 2d 1061 (2011).

Trade secrets may be subject to equitable division pursuant to ยง580-47, depending upon when the right to the trade secret vested. 99 H. 101, 53 P.3d 240.
