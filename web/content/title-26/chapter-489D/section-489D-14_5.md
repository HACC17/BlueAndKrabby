**ยง489D-14.5 Name change.** To change its name, its fictitious name, or its trade name, a licensee shall file an application with the commissioner and pay a nonrefundable fee of $1,000 or a greater amount as the commissioner shall establish by rule pursuant to chapter 91\. The application shall be approved if the commissioner is satisfied that the new name complies with all applicable laws. Any change of name shall not affect a licensee's rights, liabilities, or obligations existing prior to the effective date thereof, and no documents of transfer shall be necessary to preserve such rights, liabilities, or obligations; provided that the commissioner may require notice to be given to the public and other governmental agencies.
