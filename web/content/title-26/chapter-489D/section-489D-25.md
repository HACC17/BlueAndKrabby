**[ยง489D-25] Suspension or revocation of authorized delegates.** (a) The commissioner may issue an order suspending or revoking the designation of an authorized delegate, if the commissioner finds that:

(1) The authorized delegate violates this chapter or a rule adopted or an order issued under this chapter;

(2) The authorized delegate does not cooperate with an examination or investigation by the commissioner;

(3) The authorized delegate engages in fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or gross negligence;

(4) The authorized delegate is convicted of a violation of a federal or state anti-money laundering statute;

(5) The competence, experience, character, or general fitness of the authorized delegate or a person in control of the delegate indicates that it is not in the public interest to permit the delegate to provide money services; or

(6) The authorized delegate is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice.

(b) In determining whether an authorized delegate is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice, the commissioner may consider the size and condition of the delegate's provision of money services, the magnitude of the loss, the gravity of the violation of this chapter, and the previous conduct of the delegate.

(c) An authorized delegate may apply for relief from a suspension or revocation of designation as an authorized delegate according to procedures prescribed by the commissioner. [L 2006, c 153, pt of ยง1]
