**[ยง487J-4] Reporting requirements.** A government agency shall submit a written report to the legislature within twenty days after the discovery of a material occurrence of a social security number disclosure by the government agency that is prohibited by this chapter. The report shall contain information relating to the nature of the incident, the number of individuals affected by the incident, and any procedures that have been implemented to prevent the incident from reoccurring. In the event that a law enforcement agency informs the government agency that the report may impede a criminal investigation or jeopardize national security, the report to the legislature may be delayed until twenty days after the law enforcement agency has determined that the report will no longer impede the investigation or jeopardize national security.
