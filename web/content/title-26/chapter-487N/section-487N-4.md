**[ยง487N-4] Reporting requirements.** A government agency shall submit a written report to the legislature within twenty days after discovery of a security breach at the government agency that details information relating to the nature of the breach, the number of individuals affected by the breach, a copy of the notice of security breach that was issued, the number of individuals to whom the notice was sent, whether the notice was delayed due to law enforcement considerations, and any procedures that have been implemented to prevent the breach from reoccurring. In the event that a law enforcement agency informs the government agency that notification may impede a criminal investigation or jeopardize national security, the report to the legislature may be delayed until twenty days after the law enforcement agency has determined that notice will no longer impede the investigation or jeopardize national security. [L 2006, c 135, pt of ยง2]
