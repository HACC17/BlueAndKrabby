**[ยง481F-6] Sign required.** In each place of business in the State where a seller of print multiples is regularly engaged in the sale of prints, the seller shall post a conspicuous sign in a location reasonably calculated to bring the sign to the attention of purchasers. The sign shall contain the following passage in a legible format:

"Hawaii law requires written disclosure of specific information concerning print multiples. This information is intended to assist you in judging the degree of uniqueness or scarcity of the prints and in understanding the means by which the prints were created. The seller will furnish the written disclosure to you at your request or in any event before purchase."
