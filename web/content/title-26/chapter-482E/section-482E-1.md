(2) The details of the contract between the franchisor and franchisee; and

(3) The prior business experience of the franchisor.

(b) It is the intent of the legislature to:

(1) Provide each prospective franchisee with the information necessary to make an intelligent decision regarding franchises being offered;

(2) Prohibit the sale of franchises that would lead to fraud or a likelihood that the franchisor's promises would not be fulfilled; and

(3) Protect the franchisor or subfranchisor by providing a better understanding of the relationship between the franchisor or subfranchisor and the franchisee with regard to their business relationship. [L 1974, c 18, pt of ยง1; gen ch 1985; am L 2008, c 19, ยง46]
