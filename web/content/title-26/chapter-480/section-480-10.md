**§480-10 Exemption of labor organizations.** The labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to forbid the existence and operation of labor organizations, instituted for the purpose of mutual help, and not having capital stock or conducted for profits, or to forbid or restrain individual members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof; nor shall such organizations, or the members thereof, lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof be held or construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade under this chapter.

This chapter shall not apply to the conduct or activities of labor organizations or their members which conduct or activities are regulated by federal or state legislation or over which the National Labor Relations Board or the Hawaii labor relations board has jurisdiction. [L 1961, c 190, §8; Supp, §205A-8; [HRS §480-10](/title-26/chapter-480/section-480-10/); am L 1986, c 339, §77]
