**ยง489-5 Other discriminatory practices.** (a) It is a discriminatory practice for two or more persons to conspire:

(1) To retaliate or discriminate against a person because the person has opposed an unfair discriminatory practice;

(2) To aid, abet, incite, or coerce a person to engage in a discriminatory practice; or

(3) Wilfully, to obstruct, or prevent, a person from complying with this chapter.

(b) It is a discriminatory practice to deny a person the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodations because of the known disability of an individual with whom the person is known to have a relationship or association. [L 1986, c 292, pt of ยง1; am L 1994, c 88, ยง3]

Case Notes

Summary judgment granted in favor of defendants with respect to a plaintiff's (a nonprofit corporation) claims under subsection (b); plaintiffs offered nothing to indicate that one of the defendants was hostile toward the disabled in general or those suffering with epilepsy in particular; without the evidence, plaintiffs' claim that the defendant denied the nonprofit corporation the full and equal enjoyment of a place of public accommodation because of the nonprofit corporation's association with persons known to be disabled was totally devoid of factual support. 300 F. Supp. 2d 1003.
