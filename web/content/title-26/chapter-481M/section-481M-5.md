**[ยง481M-5] Limit on total lease payments.** (a) No lessor shall offer a lease-purchase agreement in which the total lease payments necessary to acquire ownership exceed twice the cash price of the rented property.

(b) When fifty per cent of all rental payments made by a lessee equals the cash price of the property disclosed to the lessee in the lease-purchase agreement, the lessee shall own the rented property and the lease-purchase agreement shall terminate. [L 1997, c 248, pt of ยง1]
