**§481B-13 Gift certificates.** (a) Any restaurant or person engaged in the business of offering services or goods for sale at retail may allow customers to purchase gift certificates. A certificate issuer shall not charge a service fee, including but not limited to a service fee for dormancy or inactivity. Any activation or issuance fee charged shall not exceed the lesser of ten per cent of the face value of the certificate or $5.

(b) The date of issuance and the expiration date shall be clearly identified on the face of the gift certificate, or, if an electronic card with a banked dollar value, clearly printed upon a sales receipt transferred to the purchaser of the electronic card upon the completed transaction. The expiration date shall be not less than five years after the date of issuance; provided that the expiration date of certificates issued only in paper form shall be not less than two years after the date of issuance. If the gift certificate does not have an expiration date, it shall be valid in perpetuity.

(c) Gift certificates that are issued as part of an awards, loyalty, or promotional program, or to a not-for-profit charity organization, where no money or anything of value is given to the issuer by the consumer in exchange for the gift certificate, are exempt from this section; provided that the expiration date, if any, appears on the gift certificate or accompanying printed receipt.

(d) Any violation of this section shall constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice in the conduct of trade or commerce within the meaning of section 480-2.
