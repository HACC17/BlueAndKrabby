**[ยง481B-24] Exceptions.** (a) A person who in good faith registers a domain name consisting of the name of another living person, or a name substantially and confusingly similar thereto, shall not be liable under section 481B-22 if the name is used in, affiliated with, or related to a work of authorship protected under Title 17, United States Code, including a work made for hire as defined in section 101 of Title 17, United States Code, and if the person registering the domain name is the copyright owner or licensee of the work, the person intends to sell the domain name in conjunction with the lawful exploitation of the work, and the registration is not prohibited by a contract between the registrant and the named person. The exception under this subsection shall apply only to a civil action brought under this part and shall in no manner limit the protections afforded under the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.) or other federal or state law.

(b) The domain name registrar or registry or other domain name authority shall not be liable for damages or other remedies under section 481B-25 for the registration or maintenance of a domain name for another, regardless of whether the domain name is finally determined to infringe the mark.
