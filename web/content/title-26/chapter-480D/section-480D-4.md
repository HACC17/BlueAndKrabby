**[ยง480D-4] Enforcement.** (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), any person who engages in any practice prohibited by this chapter shall be deemed to have engaged in an unfair method of competition or unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce within the meaning of section 480-2.

(b) In any case involving violations of section 480D-3(3) or (8), the debt collector shall not be subject to the provisions of subsection (a) if the debt collector can prove that the violation resulted from a bona fide error, notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid such error. Examples of bona fide error include, but are not limited to, clerical miscalculations, computer malfunction, printing errors, and computer programming errors. If bona fide error is proven, the debt collector shall:

(1) Correct the error as expeditiously as possible and make every reasonable effort to correct any consequences of that error; and

(2) Be liable for any actual damages suffered by the consumer including the time and expense required to correct the error.

A court may award reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the consumer in insuring that the error and its consequences are corrected. [L 1987, c 191, pt of ยง2]
