The commissioner may share information, including otherwise confidential information, with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the federal government, insurance regulatory agencies of foreign countries, or insurance departments of other states, territories, and commonwealths if the statutes or regulations of the jurisdiction receiving the information require the receiving person or entity to maintain the same level of confidentiality as required under this subsection and other applicable law.
