**§486-114 Advertising packages for sale.** Whenever a package is advertised in any manner, excluding its labeling, and the retail price of the package is stated in the advertisement, there shall be closely and conspicuously associated with such statement of price a declaration of the basic quantity of contents of the package as is required by law or rule to appear on the package; provided that, where the law or rule requires a dual declaration of net quantity to appear on the package, only the declaration that sets forth the quantity in terms of the smaller unit of measure (the declaration that is required to appear first and without parentheses on the package) need appear in the advertisement; and provided further that there shall not be included as part of the declaration required under this section such qualifying terms as "when packed", "minimum", "not less than", or other terms of similar import, nor any term qualifying a unit of measure (for example, "jumbo", "giant", "full", and the like) that tends to exaggerate the amount of commodity in the package. [L 1991, c 153, pt of §6; am L 1993, c 54, §9]
