**ยง486-54 Investigations.** The administrator may, upon the administrator's initiative, investigate suspected violations of this part and shall investigate each complaint registered under this part. The administrator may resort to suitable warnings rather than prosecution for minor offenses or those offenses which have been discontinued should the administrator so elect.
