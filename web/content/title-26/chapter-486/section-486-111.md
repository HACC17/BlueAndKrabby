**ยง486-111 Packages; information required; variations; exemptions.** Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any package introduced or delivered for introduction into or received in intrastate commerce, kept for the purpose of sale, or offered or exposed for sale, shall bear on the outside of the package definite, plain, and conspicuous declarations of:

(1) The identity of the commodity in the package, unless the commodity can be identified easily through the wrapper or container;

(2) The net quantity of the contents in terms of measure; and

(3) In the case of any package kept, offered, or exposed for sale, or sold in any place other than on the premises where packed, the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, as may be prescribed by rule of the board;

provided that, in connection with the declaration of net quantity, neither the qualifying term "when packed" or words of similar import, nor any term qualifying a unit of measure (for example, "jumbo", "giant", "full", and the like) that tends to exaggerate the amount of commodity in the package shall be used; and provided further that the board may, by rule, establish reasonable variations from the declared measure and exemptions pertaining to the required declarations.
