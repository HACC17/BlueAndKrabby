**ยง486-120.5 Macadamia nuts; labeling requirements.** (a) If a label on a consumer package contains language that all of the raw or processed macadamia nuts contained in the package were grown in Hawaii, the label shall be worded, "100% Hawaii-Grown Macadamia Nuts", "Hawaii-Grown Macadamia Nuts", "100% Hawaiian Macadamia Nuts", or "Hawaiian Macadamia Nuts", and shall appear on the principal display panel of the package.

(b) If a label on a consumer package contains language that a portion of the raw or processed macadamia nuts contained in the package was grown in Hawaii, the label shall be worded "Hawaii-Grown Macadamia Nuts", preceded by the per cent by weight of the macadamia nuts contained in the package that were grown in Hawaii, and shall appear on the principal display panel of the package. The per cent by weight of the macadamia nuts in the package shall be the percentage calculated by dividing the weight in pounds of the macadamia nuts grown in Hawaii that are in the package by the weight in pounds of all macadamia nuts in the package and multiplying the quotient by one hundred.

(1) To use a label containing the words, "100% Hawaii-Grown Macadamia Nuts", "Hawaii-Grown Macadamia Nuts", "100% Hawaiian Macadamia Nuts", or "Hawaiian Macadamia Nuts", or similar wording, or to otherwise represent that all of the macadamia nuts in the package were grown in Hawaii, if any portion of the macadamia nuts contained in the package was not grown in the State;

(2) To use a label, as provided for under subsection (b), containing the words "Hawaii-Grown Macadamia Nuts" preceded by a percentage, if less than the specified percentage or none of the macadamia nuts in the package was grown in the State; or

(3) To use a label representing that any of the macadamia nuts contained in the package was grown in the State, if none of the macadamia nuts contained in the package was grown in the State.
