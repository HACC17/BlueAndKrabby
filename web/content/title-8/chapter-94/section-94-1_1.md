**[ยง94-1.1] Definitions.** For the purposes of this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:

"Disposition" means actions resulting in the transfer to the state archives or destruction of records as documented in the records retention and disposition schedule or other authority.

"Enduring value" means the continued significance of records determined by their legal, fiscal, administrative, or historical value that warrants their preservation by the state archives.

"Preservation" means a series of managed activities necessary to protect machine readable records from loss, alteration, deterioration, and technological obsolescence to ensure an accurate rendering of those records in perpetuity in an environment independent from that which produced them.

"Records" means information with fixed form and content, regardless of physical form or characteristics, created or received in the course of government activity and set aside as evidence of that activity. In databases, "records" mean a collection of related data fields.

"Records retention and disposition schedule" means a records disposition authorization (form SA-1) or general records schedule issued by the state comptroller, pursuant to section 94-3\. [L 2013, c 88, pt of ยง1]
