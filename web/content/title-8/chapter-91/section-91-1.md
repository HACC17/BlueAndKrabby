Where a hearing on a petition for a declaratory order before the public utilities commission was discretionary and not required by law, the dismissal order was not a contested case under paragraph (5); therefore, as a direct appeal to the intermediate appellate court (ICA) under §91-14(b) and §269-15.5 only applied to contested cases, appellant power company was not entitled to appeal the dismissal order directly to the ICA; thus, the ICA lacked jurisdiction over appellant's appeal. 126 H. 242 (App.), 269 P.3d 777.

Water resource management commission's distinctive treatment of "nonagricultural uses", such as golf course irrigation, in its water use permit and policy decision did not constitute "illegal rulemaking" where commission did not propose any general rules automatically applicable in all circumstances, but instead devised a principled solution to a specific dispute based on "facts applied to rules that have already been promulgated by the legislature". 94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.

Planning and permitting department's policy of refusing to publicly disclose developer's engineering reports prior to their approval constituted a "rule"; as this policy was not "published or made available for public inspection" nor did plaintiff have actual knowledge of the policy prior to its initial request for the reports, department did not comply with this chapter and was proscribed from invoking this policy; thus, department violated this chapter by refusing to publicly disclose any unaccepted engineering reports and written comments, and all of its files, including developer's file, were public records that could be examined upon request. 119 H. 90, 194 P.3d 531.
