**[ยง91-4.4] Form of publication.** The revisor of statutes shall determine the form in which the Hawaii administrative rules index and its supplements shall be published. Either or both of the publications may be issued in units, in bound or loose-leaf form, separately or in combination, at the same or different times, as the revisor considers most economical and best adapted to make the index available to interested persons and the public. [L 1979, c 216, pt of ยง2]
