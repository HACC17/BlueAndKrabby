**[ยง92-15.5] Nonattendance of board member; expiration of term.** (a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the term of a board member shall expire upon the failure of the member, without valid excuse, to attend three consecutive meetings duly noticed to all members of the board and where the board failed to constitute quorum necessary to transact board business. The chair or acting chair of the board shall determine if the absence of the member is excusable. The expiration of the member's term shall be effective immediately after the third consecutive unattended meeting and unexcused absence. The vacancy shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment.

(b) This section shall not apply to ex officio members of a board.

(c) Notwithstanding the definition of "board" in section 92-2, this section shall apply only to a state board and shall not apply to a board of any political subdivision of the State or whose authority is strictly advisory. [L 2004, c 234, ยง1]
