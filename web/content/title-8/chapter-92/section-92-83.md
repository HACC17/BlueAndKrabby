**[ยง92-83] Neighborhood board meeting; unanticipated events; public interest.** An unanticipated event that occurs after public notice of a neighborhood board meeting has been issued, but before the scheduled meeting, may be the subject of discussion at the scheduled meeting if timely action on the matter is necessary for public health, welfare, and safety. At a duly noticed meeting, a board may take action on an unanticipated event in the public interest that is not on the agenda in the same manner as if the board had held an emergency meeting to take action on the issue, pursuant to section 92-8\.
