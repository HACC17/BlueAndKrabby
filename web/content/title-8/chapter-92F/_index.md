Case Notes

Chapter did not require defendant to disclose development proposals. 74 H. 365, 846 P.2d 882.

Chapter applies prospectively, requiring disclosure of records maintained by state agencies regardless of when the records came into existence. 83 H. 378, 927 P.2d 386.

Chapter not a "conflicting statute on the same subject matter" as chapter 89, within the meaning of §89-19, and thus is not preempted by chapter 89 or any collective bargaining agreement negotiated under it. 83 H. 378, 927 P.2d 386.

Confidentiality provision in police union's collective bargaining agreement with city unenforceable where provision prevents police department from performing its duties under this chapter. 83 H. 378, 927 P.2d 386.

Where trial court determined that any unaccepted engineering reports were returned to the developer and there was a lack of evidence suggesting that the city planning and permitting department "maintained" any reports or copies of the reports that were unaccepted by the department, trial court properly determined that, pursuant to this chapter, the reports submitted to the department in connection with the developer's subdivision application did not constitute "government records" prior to their acceptance by the department. 119 H. 90, 194 P.3d 531.

As judicial financial disclosure statements are judicial records, created and governed by rule 15 of the rules of the supreme court, promulgated by the court pursuant to its inherent and constitutional judicial authority to regulate judges, and the authority to promulgate rules and keep records with regard to judicial qualification and discipline matters (1) fall within the scope of the court's power to adjudicate, and (2) is inherently intertwined with such adjudicative power, the rules and records are not subject to this chapter or review by the office of information practices. 121 H. 179, 215 P.3d 411.

In a suit deciding whether disclosure of county council executive session minutes was required, circuit court properly found that both chapter 92 and this chapter applied; if the meeting met an exception to the open meeting requirements put forth in chapter 92, such as an exception enumerated in §92-5, the council was not required to disclose the minutes of that meeting to the public; if the meeting did not fall under such an exception, the council was required to disclose the minutes pursuant to §92-9 and §92F-12\. 120 H. 34 (App.), 200 P.3d 403.
