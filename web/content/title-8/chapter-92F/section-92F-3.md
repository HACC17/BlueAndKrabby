It includes, but is not limited to, the individual's education, financial, medical, or employment history, or items that contain or make reference to the individual's name, identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph. [L 1988, c 262, pt of §1]

Case Notes

Nonprofit corporation was not an "agency" within the meaning of this section where because: (1) it was the sole title owner of its equipment and the lessee of its offices and facilities, it was not "owned" by the State; (2) the State did not manage its day-to-day operations and its employees were not state employees, it was not "operated" by the State; (3) the State did not control, direct, or exercise skill or judgment over corporation's activities or business affairs, it was not "managed" by the State; and (4) corporation's activities were not a required function of any government agency, it did not perform a government function "on behalf of" the State. 116 H. 337, 173 P.3d 484.

Where trial court determined that any unaccepted engineering reports were returned to the developer and there was a lack of evidence suggesting that the city planning and permitting department "maintained" any reports or copies of the reports that were unaccepted by the department, trial court properly determined that, pursuant to this chapter, the reports submitted to the department in connection with the developer's subdivision application did not constitute "government records" prior to their acceptance by the department. 119 H. 90, 194 P.3d 531.
