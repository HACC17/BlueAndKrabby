**[ยง539-6] Effect of registration in beneficiary form.** The designation of a transfer-on-death beneficiary on a registration in beneficiary form has no effect on ownership until the owner's death. A registration of a security in beneficiary form may be canceled or changed at any time by the sole owner or all then surviving owners without the consent of the beneficiary. [L 1998, c 63, pt of ยง1]
