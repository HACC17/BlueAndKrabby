**[****ยง531B-6] Forfeiture of right to direct disposition.** A person entitled under law to the right of disposition shall forfeit that right, and the right is passed on to the next person in the order of priority as listed in section 531B-4, under the following circumstances:

(1) The person is charged with murder or manslaughter in connection with the decedent's death, and the charges are known to the funeral director or manager of the funeral establishment, cemetery, mortuary, or crematory; provided that if the charges against the person are dismissed, or if the person is acquitted of the charges, the right of disposition is returned to that person, unless the dismissal or acquittal occurs after the final disposition has been completed;

(2) The person does not exercise the person's right of disposition within five days of notification of the decedent's death or within seven days of the decedent's death, whichever is earlier;

(3) The person and the decedent are spouses, civil union partners, or reciprocal beneficiaries, and at the time of the decedent's death, proceedings for annulment, divorce, or separation had been initiated or a declaration for termination of the reciprocal beneficiary relationship had been filed; or
