**[****ยง531B-3] Direction for disposition.** A person may provide written directions for the location, manner, and conditions of disposition of the person's remains in a testamentary disposition, in a pre-need contract pursuant to chapter 441, or by any written document signed by the person and notarized. The written directions may also include arrangements for funeral goods and services to be provided upon that person's death and shall take precedence over wishes or other direction by any other person.
