§**533-10 Barred by deed.** A woman may bar her right of dower, in any land conveyed by her husband, by joining with him in the deed conveying the same, and therein releasing her claim to dower, or by a separate deed releasing the same, made at the time of the conveyance by her husband, or subsequently; or she may delegate to an attorney in fact other than her husband, the power to execute such release, either by general or special power of attorney, and her execution and acknowledgment of the power of attorney may be in the same manner as if she were sole; or by agreement made in contemplation of divorce or judicial separation as provided by section 572-22.

No release of dower duly executed by the attorney in fact of any married woman prior to April 18, 1898, shall be invalid or inoperative merely by reason of its not having been executed by the married woman in person. [CC 1859, §1308; am L 1898, c 13, §§1-2; RL 1925, §3026; RL 1935, §4839; am L 1939, c 33, §3; RL 1945, §12109; RL 1955, §319-10; [HRS §533-10](/title-29/chapter-533/section-533-10/)]
