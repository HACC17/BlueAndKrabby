**[****ยง356D-13.5] Housing choice voucher program administration.** Any housing choice voucher program voucher issued by the authority shall automatically be returned to the authority upon the death or removal from assistance of the last original household member; provided that, where the original head or co-head of the household is survived by a minor who was subsequently added to the household by birth, adoption, or court order and the family properly reported the birth, adoption, or court order to the authority, the household may retain the voucher until the youngest minor added to the household reaches the age of twenty-one, or reaches the age of twenty-three if the youngest minor is a full-time student at a business school, technical school, college, community college, or university. No legal guardian shall be added to the household to care for the minor or minors unless the legal guardian is also eligible for participation in the housing choice voucher program; provided further that any legal guardian added to the household shall not retain the voucher after the youngest minor has reached the age of twenty-one, or has reached the age of twenty-three if the youngest minor is a full-time student at a business school, technical school, college, community college, or university.
