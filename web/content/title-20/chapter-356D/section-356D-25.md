**[§356D-25] Investment of reserves, etc.** The authority may invest any funds held in reserves or sinking funds or any funds not required for immediate disbursement, including the proceeds of bonds, in property or securities in which the director of finance may legally invest, as provided in section 36-21; provided that funds held outside the state treasury may be invested for terms not to exceed thirty-five years. No provisions with respect to the acquisition, operation, or disposition of property by other government agencies shall be applicable to the authority unless the legislature shall specifically so state.
