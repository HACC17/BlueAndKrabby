**§350C-1 Findings and purposes.** The legislature finds that to obtain adoptive families for children with special needs, states must assure prospective adoptive parents of substantial assistance in meeting the high costs of supporting and providing for the child's special needs. The purpose of this chapter is to authorize the department of human services to enter into interstate agreements for the protection of children who receive adoption assistance from the State.
