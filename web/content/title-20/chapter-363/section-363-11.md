**§363-11 Special housing for disabled veterans.** The office shall develop rules to specify the amount to be provided a veteran for the purpose of bearing the cost not borne by the federal government for a specially designed home for disabled veterans. The veteran must have been a bona fide resident of the State before entering active service with the armed forces and must qualify for a federal grant under the Veterans Administration's Specially Adapted Housing program. In no event shall the State pay a qualified veteran a share greater than the federal government toward the purchase or remodeling of such home.

The moneys provided shall be expended only on vouchers drawn by the comptroller based on application therefor approved by the office in accordance with this section, to the extent permitted by the applicable appropriation.
