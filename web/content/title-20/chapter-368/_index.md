Case Notes

Section 368 [sic], which was quite similar to Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), found to be the most "analogous" state statute regarding applicable limitations period for plaintiff's ADA claim; since statutory period of ninety days was appropriately "borrowed" and became part of plaintiff's ADA claim, and since plaintiff filed suit within this time period, plaintiff's claim was not time-barred under ADA limitations period; passenger ticket contract did not trump applicable state law and ADA limitations periods. 51 F. Supp. 2d 1057 (1999).

Plaintiff's [chapters] 368 and 378 state law claims against the county were time-barred under §46-72, where plaintiff never provided the county written notice of plaintiff's claim. 504 F. Supp. 2d 969 (2007).

Plaintiff's charges filed with the equal employment opportunity commission were deemed "dual-filed" with the Hawaii civil rights commission. Plaintiff timely filed the charge for claims under chapter 378 based on plaintiff's termination within the 180-day time limitation. 907 F. Supp. 2d 1143 (2012).
