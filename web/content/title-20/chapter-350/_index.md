Case Notes

Hawaii legislature did not intend to create a duty that would subject a private party (and analogously the government) to tort liability based upon a failure to report in violation of this chapter. 711 F. Supp. 2d 1195 (2010).

Nothing in this chapter prevents the issuance of a search warrant based on information obtained by the department or the police while investigating an abuse case. 70 H. 627, 780 P.2d 1103 (1989).
