**ยง353-25 Powers and duties of conservator.** Every conservator appointed for any committed person shall pay all the just debts due from the committed person out of the committed person's personal estate, if sufficient, and if not, out of the committed person's real estate, upon obtaining an order for the sale thereof from the judge. The conservator shall also settle all accounts of the committed person, and demand, sue for, and receive all debts due to the committed person, and, with the approbation of the judge, may compound for the same and give a discharge to the debtor. The conservator shall appear for and represent the ward in all legal suits and proceedings, except when another person is appointed for that purpose.

The conservator shall have all the rights and duties, as well as the responsibilities, respecting the management and disposal of the committed person's estate, as appertain to the guardian or conservator of a minor or insane person. The conservator shall manage the estate without waste, and the profits thereof, so far as may be necessary, for the comfortable and suitable maintenance of the committed person's family, if there be any, and if the profits are insufficient for that purpose, may sell the real estate and apply the proceeds thereto, upon obtaining the license of the judge.
