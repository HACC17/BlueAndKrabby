**ยง353-15 Transfer of committed persons affected with communicable disease.** Upon written recommendation of the director of health that a committed person determined to have a communicable disease be removed to any hospital, settlement, or place for care and treatment of the communicable disease as designated by the director of health for such specialized care and treatment, the director of public safety may direct any official having custody of any committed person convicted of a felony and incarcerated in a state correctional facility to cause the committed person to be removed to such a place as designated by the director of health, until discharged under chapter 325 or 326 or until the maximum sentence has been served. Any such committed person who may be discharged before the maximum term of imprisonment shall be returned to the state correctional facility from which the committed person was removed.
