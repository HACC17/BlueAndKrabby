**[****ยง353-134] Compliance by department; no cause of action.** The department shall ensure that the offender information contained within the system is updated on a regular basis sufficient to timely notify a victim or a concerned member of the community of the offender's release, discharge, or escape. However, failure of the system to provide notice to the victim or a concerned member of the community shall not establish a separate cause of action by the victim or a concerned member of the community against the State, any county, or any state or county agency, officer, or employee.
