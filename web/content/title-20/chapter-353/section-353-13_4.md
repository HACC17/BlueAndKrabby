**[ยง353-13.4] Substance abuse testing of inmates.** (a) When an inmate under the custody of the department of public safety is subjected to substance abuse testing, the inmate shall be afforded the option of a confirmatory test by a licensed, certified laboratory as provided in chapter 329B. The cost of a confirmatory test shall be paid for by the State; provided that in those instances where a positive test result is confirmed, the inmate shall be charged with the cost of the confirmatory test.

(b) All specimens shall be sealed and coded in the presence of the inmate and the inmate shall sign an approved form acknowledging that the specimen has been sealed and coded in the inmate's presence. The director of the department of public safety shall establish a chain-of-custody procedure that includes a tracking form documenting the handling and storage of the specimen from collection to final disposition of the specimen.

(c) Positive test results of substance abuse testing and the availability of a confirmatory test shall be provided to the inmate in writing.
