**ยง353-23 Disposition of property subject to action for damages.** No disposition of any estate, either by will or otherwise, after the arrest for crime of which the committed person was convicted, whether the sentence is for life or otherwise, shall have any advantage or preference over the claim of any person entitled to damages for a private injury committed by the criminal, unless the disposition was made for a valuable and equivalent consideration to a person ignorant of the arrest. [L 1987, c 338, pt of ยง3]
