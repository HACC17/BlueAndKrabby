**§353-67 Education as condition for paroles.** The Hawaii paroling authority may require, as a condition of parole, that a parolee further the parolee's education and training by taking occupational training courses or general education courses, or both, whenever such courses are deemed by the paroling authority to be capable of making a substantial contribution to the rehabilitation of the parolee. The paroling authority may in its discretion designate the educational institution or institutions the parolee is to attend and may pay the cost of tuition and other fees for said courses.
