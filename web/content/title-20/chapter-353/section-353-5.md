**ยง353-5 Offender release recommendations to the court.** The intake service center shall notify the prosecutor's office of the appropriate county whenever it is recommending to the court that a person who is accused of murder or attempted murder in any degree or a class A felony involving force or violence against another person be conditionally released or that bail for such person be lowered. Such notice shall be made upon the completion of the intake service center's investigation on the offender's case so as to allow the prosecutor's office of the appropriate county to be present when the court considers the recommendation. [L 1987, c 338, pt of ยง3]
