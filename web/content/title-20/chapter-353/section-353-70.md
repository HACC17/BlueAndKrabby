**§353-70 Final discharge.** Whenever, in its opinion, any paroled prisoner has given such evidence as is deemed reliable and trustworthy that the paroled prisoner will remain at liberty without violating the law and that the paroled prisoner's final release is not incompatible with the welfare of society, the Hawaii paroling authority may grant the prisoner a written discharge from further liability under the prisoner's sentence.

Any paroled prisoner who has been on parole for at least five years shall be brought before the paroling authority for purposes of consideration for final discharge and complete pardon. In the event the prisoner is not granted a final discharge and full pardon, the paroled prisoner shall be brought before the paroling authority for the aforementioned purposes annually thereafter.

Any person, who, while on parole, enters the military service of the United States, may, upon the person's honorable discharge therefrom, petition the paroling authority for a final discharge, and the paroling authority may consider the honorable discharge as grounds for granting a final discharge from parole and recommending to the governor a full pardon.
