**[ยง353-13.5] Election of private medical or psychological care by prisoners.** The director shall permit prisoners to retain any private licensed medical doctor or psychologist for their own care at the correctional facility in addition to such care as may be provided by the department; provided that any fees or other costs charged by a private medical doctor or psychologist for such care shall be the sole responsibility of the prisoner and that such care shall not put the correctional facility to any hazard and that such care shall conform to the department's rules and established practices including any requirements concerning advance notice of visits with the prisoner. Medical doctors or psychologists who provide such care shall provide timely reports to the department as to the physical or psychological progress of the prisoner. If the private care is discontinued, the department shall be notified immediately by the private medical doctor or psychologist. In no event shall the department or the State incur any civil liability whatsoever as a result of any private medical or psychological care administered under this section. [L 1987, c 128, ยง1]
