**ยง352-16 Establishment of work release.** (a) The director, in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the director, may establish a work release plan for persons who are committed to the director's care and who are receiving care and treatment in a youth correctional facility; provided that such a plan shall not interfere with any educational program in which such persons may be enrolled.

(b) Under such a work release plan, any such person may be authorized to secure or continue in suitable employment outside of such youth correctional facility, and unless otherwise authorized by the department with respect to specific cases, return to and remain in such facility during non-working hours.

(c) Employment under such a work release plan may be at a wage less than the minimum wage authorized in chapter 387; provided that no more than five hours of a person's workweek shall be paid at wages less than the minimum wage.

(d) It shall be the duty of the employer of a person participating in a work release plan to transmit to the director the earnings of such persons. The transmission to the director of the earnings of such person shall operate to discharge such employer from any further obligation to such person except with respect to any taxes lawfully withheld from the wages of such person.

(e) The earnings transmitted to the director by a person's employer under a work release plan shall be held to the account of such person. [L 1980, c 303, pt of ยง8(1); am L 1981, c 224, ยง1]
