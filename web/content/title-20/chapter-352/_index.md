Case Notes

As this chapter clearly mandates that youth correctional facilities be placed under the supervision of the department of human services, the Hawaii youth correctional facility is a state correctional facility. 113 H. 60, 148 P.3d 493 (2006).

Community correctional center holding unit was not a "facility". 7 H. App. 247, 753 P.2d 816 (1988).
