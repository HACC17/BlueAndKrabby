**[ยง347-20 Legislative findings.]** The legislature finds that it is the policy of this State to encourage and enable the blind, the visually handicapped, and the otherwise physically disabled to participate fully in the social and economic life of the State and to engage in remunerative employment. The legislature also finds that the blind, the visually handicapped, and the otherwise physically disabled have the same right as the able-bodied to the full and free use of the streets, highways, sidewalks, walkways, public buildings, public facilities, and other public places. The legislature declares that it is the policy of this State that the blind, the visually handicapped, and the otherwise physically disabled shall be employed in the state service, in the service of the political subdivisions of the State, in the public schools, and in all other employment supported in whole or in part by public funds on the same terms and conditions as the able-bodied, unless it is shown that the particular disability prevents the performance of the work involved. [L 1972, c 75, ยง1]
