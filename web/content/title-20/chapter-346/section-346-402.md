**[ยง346-402] Court-appointed attorneys****.** The court may appoint an attorney sua sponte or at the request of any party to represent a young adult who is eligible under section 346-395 and has signed the voluntary care agreement as described in section [346-396] if it is deemed by the court to be in the young adult's best interest. Attorneys who are appointed by the court to represent a qualifying young adult may be paid by the court, unless the young adult for whom counsel is appointed has an independent estate sufficient to pay fees and costs.
