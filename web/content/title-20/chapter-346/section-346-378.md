**§346-378** **Housing first programs.** (a) The department of human services, in consultation with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, as necessary, shall implement housing first programs and services, as the department deems appropriate for clientele who would most likely benefit from and succeed with the implementation of housing first programs and services, and subject to the availability of existing funds.

(b) The principles of housing first include:

(1) Moving chronically homeless individuals into housing directly from streets and shelters, without a precondition of accepting or complying with treatment; provided that the department may condition continued tenancy through a housing first program on participation in treatment services;

(2) Providing robust support services for program participants, predicated on assertive engagement instead of coercion;

(3) Granting chronically homeless individuals priority as program participants in housing first programs;

(4) Embracing a harm-reduction approach to addictions, rather than mandating abstinence, while supporting program-participant commitments to recovery; and

(5) Providing program-participants with leases and tenant protections as provided by law.

The department of human services may contract with housing first consultants to effectuate the purposes of this section.

(c) Housing first programs shall incorporate the following:

(1) Identification of target populations, specifically chronically homeless individuals;

(2) Developing assessments for the chronically homeless population;

(3) Developing service components, including:

(A) Financial assistance;

(B) In-home case management services;

(C) Affordable housing requirements;

(D) Landlord cultivation;

(E) Housing-placement requirements; and

(F) Support services to move program-participants toward self-sufficiency.

(d) The department of human services shall submit an annual report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session, beginning with the regular session of 2011\. The annual report shall include:

(2) The annual costs of the programs;

(3) The types of support services offered; and

(e) As used in this section, "chronically homeless individual" means a homeless individual who has an addiction or a mental illness, or both. [L 2010, c 212, pt of §2, §5; am L 2016, c 42, §6]

Revision Note

In subsections (a), (b), and (d), "the department of human services" was substituted for "the Hawaii public housing authority, in collaboration with the department of human services" pursuant to §23G-15.
