(b) Reimbursement rates paid to federally qualified health centers may be adjusted if costs exceed 1.75 per cent for changes related to the intensity, duration, or amount of service provided, facilities, regulatory requirements, or other extraordinary circumstances; provided that the federally qualified health center shall submit to the department an adjusted cost report covering a period of the previous two years. The director shall review the filing within a period of sixty days. The period may be extended by the director for an additional period not to exceed thirty days upon written notice to the filer. A filing shall be deemed to be approved unless disapproved by the director within the initial filing period or any extension thereof.
