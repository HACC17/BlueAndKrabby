**§346-41.5 Hawaii qualified health centers.** If the medicaid managed care program is implemented, the department shall provide a supplemental capitation program for the uninsured with enabling services based on an annual cost-based determination to all Hawaii qualified health centers and to any nonprofit entity having a majority of Hawaii qualified health centers as board members.

For the purposes of this section, "enabling services" includes enabling services as defined by federally qualified health center standards. The department shall have the administrative flexibility to expend funds through medicaid managed care contracts, through a modified voucher system, or through chapter 42F. Hawaii qualified health centers receiving these supplemental payments shall reconcile their costs on an annual basis. [L 1994, c 238, §3; am L 2015, c 20, §3]
