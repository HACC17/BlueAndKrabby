**§346-8 Additional funds.** (a) The department of human services may accept and deposit with the director of finance, for use in carrying out any of the purposes of this chapter or for costs of administration, any funds which may be provided by the United States government, any county, or any other source, in each case upon such terms and conditions as the department, in its discretion, may approve. All such funds shall be deemed additional to the funds provided by legislative appropriation. Any such funds received in reimbursement of expenditures made from funds provided by legislative appropriation for any purpose are reappropriated for the same purpose.

(b) Except as expressly otherwise provided, all appropriations made by the legislature shall be deemed subject to the foregoing provisions, to the end that the amounts of such appropriations shall be deemed to limit the amounts expendable from the general fund of the State but not to limit the amounts expendable by the department.

(c) The department shall submit a report detailing all moneys received under this section to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session.
