**ยง346-59.6 Medicaid overpayment recovery.** The director shall recover medicaid overpayments made to providers. Medicaid overpayments shall be recovered due to a provider's ineligibility, noncovered service, noncovered drug, lack of prior authorization when a service requires one, incorrect payment allowance identified through any post payment review, or claims processing error. The director may recover overpayments through recoupment, tax offset under sections 231-51 to 231-59, and circuit court judgment. Nothing in this section shall limit the director's authority to recover overpayments through all other lawful means. [L 1998, c 293, ยง1; am L 2001, c 55, ยง16]
