(1) Receive notice of any court hearings and reviews and any other case related proceedings and meetings;

(2) Be involved in the development of a personalized case plan;

(3) Be present at all court hearings and reviews and be able to address the court during those hearings; provided that young adults may waive their right to be present at the court hearings and reviews or may request to participate in the court hearings and reviews by phone; and
