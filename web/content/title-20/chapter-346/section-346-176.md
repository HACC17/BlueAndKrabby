**[ยง346-176] Family child care system.** The department shall authorize the establishment and operation of a family child care system under which a sponsoring agency contracts family child care homes to provide care and assumes administrative tasks for the homes and providers; provided that the department shall register each of the family child care homes individually in accordance with this subpart and establish no rule or requirement which jeopardizes the status of the providers of care in family child care homes as independent contractors of the sponsoring agency. The department may establish rules defining the administrative tasks which may be performed and minimum requirements, including provision of training to providers which must be complied with by the sponsoring agency, but shall not require the sponsoring agency to register or obtain a license or registration as a child care facility unless the sponsoring agency provides care to children on the sponsoring agency's premises. [L 1985, c 208, pt of ยง2]
