**[ยง346-55.1] Visitation, custody, and support when public assistance paid.** Whenever public assistance is paid to or for the benefit of any dependent child, the existence or enforcement of a duty of support owed by a noncustodial parent to such child shall not be affected by a failure or refusal by the custodial parent to implement any right as to custody or visitation granted by a court to the noncustodial parent. [L 1983, c 66, ยง1]
