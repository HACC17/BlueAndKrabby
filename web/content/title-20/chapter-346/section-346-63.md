**[ยง346-63] Social services.** (a) The department shall adopt rules to provide social services pursuant to the Social Security Act, as amended, to eligible persons who are residents of the State. Such rules shall include provisions to permit payment for social services received by recipients from individuals, organizations, or other public or private agencies, and to enable the recipients to satisfy statutory requirements of state and federal tax and employment insurance programs.

(b) The department may contract for the purchase of social services to be performed for the benefit of eligible recipients from individuals, organizations, and private or public agencies, or to reimburse an eligible recipient for department authorized social services obtained directly from individuals. Persons performing authorized social services obtained directly by the recipient shall not be considered employees of the State. The rate of payment for social services obtained directly by the recipient from an individual who is not self-employed shall reflect the recipient's obligation under state and federal tax and employment insurance laws.
