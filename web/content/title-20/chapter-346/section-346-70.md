The pregnant woman shall be:

(2) Otherwise eligible for benefits under the State's medicaid program but is prohibited from participating in any medical assistance program under title XIX of the Social Security Act for a period of five years beginning on the date of her entry into the United States, due to restricted eligibility rules imposed by title XIX of the Social Security Act and the Personal Responsibility and Work [Opportunity] Reconciliation Act of 1996.

(b) Once determined eligible for medical assistance under this section, the pregnant woman shall continue to be eligible throughout her pregnancy and through the last day of the calendar month in which the sixty-day period following childbirth ends.
