**ยง39-58** **CUSIP numbers.** The department issuing revenue bonds pursuant to this part, in its discretion, may provide that CUSIP identification numbers shall be imprinted on the revenue bonds. In the event the numbers are imprinted on any revenue bonds:

(1) No CUSIP identification number shall constitute a part of the contract evidenced by the particular revenue bond upon which it is imprinted; and

(2) No liability shall attach to the State, the department, or any officer or agent thereof, including any fiscal agent, paying agent, or registrar for the revenue bonds, by reason of the numbers or any use made thereof, and including any use made by the State, the department, any officer or agent, or by reason of any inaccuracy, error, or omission.

The department in its discretion may require that all cost of obtaining and imprinting the CUSIP identification numbers shall be paid by the purchaser of the revenue bonds. For the purposes of this section, the term "CUSIP identification numbers" means the numbering system adopted by the Committee for Uniform Security Identification Procedures formed by the Securities Industry Association.
