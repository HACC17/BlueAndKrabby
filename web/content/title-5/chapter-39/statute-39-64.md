**§39-64** **Revenue bonds not a general or moral obligation of State.** Unless otherwise provided in this section, revenue bonds issued pursuant to this part shall be payable solely from and secured by the revenue, or the user taxes, or combination of both, of the undertaking or loan program for which the revenue bonds have been issued, pledged to the payment thereof, or secured solely by and payable solely from a special fund to be maintained from the revenue, or user taxes, or combination of both, pledged to the special fund, and shall not constitute a general or moral obligation of the State or a charge upon the general fund of the State, nor shall the full faith and credit of the State be pledged to the payment of the principal and interest thereof.

Revenue bonds issued for the purpose of establishing and administering a loan program authorized by law may also be secured by a pledge of all or a portion of undertakings, mortgages, and other obligations held by the department as security for a loan made under the program. Each revenue bond issued pursuant to this part shall recite in substance that the revenue bonds and the interest thereon are payable from and secured by the revenue, or the user taxes, or combination of both, of the undertaking or loan program for which the revenue bond is issued, pledged to the payment thereof, or secured by and payable from a special fund to be maintained from the revenue, or user taxes, or combination of both, pledged to the special fund, and that the revenue bond is not a general or moral obligation of the State and the full faith and credit of the State are not pledged to the payment of principal and interest.
