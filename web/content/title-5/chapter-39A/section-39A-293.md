**[ยง39A-293] Use of revenues derived from project agreement.** The department may appropriate, apply, or expend the revenues derived with respect to the project agreement for a project for the following purposes:

(1) To pay when due all special purpose revenue bonds, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds for the payment of which the revenues are or have been pledged, charged, or otherwise encumbered, including reserves; and

(2) To the extent not paid by the project party to provide for all expenses of administration, operation, and maintenance of the project, including reserves.

Unless and until adequate provision has been made for the foregoing purposes, the department shall not transfer the revenues derived from the project agreement to the general fund of the State. [L 2006, c 102, pt of ยง2]
