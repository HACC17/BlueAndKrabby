**ยง39A-196 Issuance of special purpose revenue bonds to finance projects.** In addition to the other powers that it may otherwise have, the department may issue special purpose revenue bonds to finance, in whole or in part, the costs of a project. All bonds issued under this part are special purpose revenue bonds and the provisions of part III of chapter 39 shall not apply thereto. All special purpose revenue bonds issued pursuant to this part shall be issued in the name of the department and not in the name of the State.

The department, in determining the cost of any project, may also include the following:

(1) Financing charges, fees, and expenses of any trustee and paying agents for special purpose revenue bonds issued to pay the cost of such project;

(2) Interest on such bonds and the expenses of the State in connection with such bonds and the project to be financed from the proceeds of such bonds accruing or incurred prior to and during the period of construction and for not exceeding six months thereafter;

(3) Amounts necessary to establish or increase reserves for the special purpose revenue bonds;

(4) The cost of plans, specifications, studies, surveys, and estimates of cost and of revenues;

(5) Other expenses incidental to determining the feasibility or practicability of the project;

(6) Administration expenses;

(7) Interest cost incurred by the project party with respect to the project prior to the issuance of the special purpose revenue bonds; and

(8) Such other costs, commissions, and expenses incidental to the construction, acquisition, reconstruction, renovation, rehabilitation, improvement, betterment, operation, or extension of the project, the financing thereof, placing of the project in operation, and the issuance of the special purpose revenue bonds, whether incurred prior to or after the issuance of such bonds.

The legislature finds and determines that the exercise of the powers vested in the department by this part constitutes assistance to utilities serving the general public and that the issuance of special purpose revenue bonds to finance facilities of, or for, or to loan the proceeds of such bonds to assist, project parties, is in the public interest.
