**[ยง39A-267] Refunding special purpose revenue bonds.** The legislature, by an act passed by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members to which each house is entitled, may authorize the issuance of refunding special purpose revenue bonds for the purpose of refunding any special purpose revenue bonds then outstanding and issued under this part, whether or not such outstanding special purpose revenue bonds have matured or are then subject to redemption.

The legislature is further authorized to provide, by an act passed by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members to which each house is entitled, for the issuance of a single issue of special purpose revenue bonds for the combined purposes of:

(1) Financing or refinancing the cost of a project or improvement or expansion of the project; and

(2) Refunding special purpose revenue bonds that shall have been issued under this part and shall then be outstanding, whether or not such outstanding special purpose revenue bonds have matured or are then subject to redemption.

Nothing in this section shall require or be deemed to require the legislature to elect to redeem or prepay special purpose revenue bonds being refunded. Moreover, nothing in this section shall require or be deemed to require the legislature to elect to redeem or prepay the special purpose revenue bonds being refunded, which were issued in the form customarily known as term bonds in accordance with any sinking fund installment schedule specified in any law authorizing the issuance thereof, or, in the event the department elects to redeem or prepay any such bonds, to redeem or prepay as of any particular date or dates. The issuance of such special purpose revenue bonds, the maturities and other details regarding the bonds, the rights and remedies of the bondholders, and the rights, powers, privileges, duties, and obligations of the department with respect to the bonds and bondholders, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this part insofar as may be applicable.
