**[ยง39A-292] Validity of special purpose revenue bonds.** The special purpose revenue bonds bearing the signature or facsimile signature of officers on the date of the signing of the bonds shall be valid and sufficient for all purposes, notwithstanding that before the delivery of and payment for the bonds, all the persons whose signatures appear on the bonds shall have ceased to be officers of the department. The special purpose revenue bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to this part, and the recital shall be conclusive evidence of their validity and of the regularity of their issuance.
