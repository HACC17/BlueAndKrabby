**ยง39A-314** **Conditions precedent to negotiating and entering into a project agreement.** (a) Prior to entering into negotiations with respect to a project agreement or at any time during the negotiations, the department shall require that as a condition to the negotiations or the continuation thereof, the project party shall agree to pay all fees, costs, and expenses assessed by the department even though a project agreement may not be entered into. The department may further require the deposit of moneys with the department as security to pay for fees, costs, and expenses. Any amount of the deposit in excess of the amount required to pay the State shall be returned by the department to the party that has made the deposit. The State shall not be required to pay to the project party any interest or earnings on the deposit.

(b) The department shall not enter into any project agreement with respect to any project unless the legislature shall have first authorized the issuance of special purpose revenue bonds to finance the project pursuant to section 39A-317 and the department has determined that:

(1) The project party is a responsible party, whether by reason of economic assets or experience in the type of enterprise to be undertaken through the project, or otherwise; or

(2) The obligations of the project party under the project agreement will be unconditionally guaranteed by a person who is a responsible party, whether by reason of economic assets or experience in the type of enterprise to be undertaken through the project, or otherwise.
