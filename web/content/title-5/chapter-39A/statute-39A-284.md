The State shall not be required to pay to the project party any interest or earnings on the deposit.

(1) The project party is a responsible party, whether by reason of economic assets or experience in the type of enterprise to be undertaken through the project or some other reason; or

(2) The obligations of the project party under the project agreement will be unconditionally guaranteed by a person who is a responsible party, whether by reason of economic assets or experience in the type of enterprise to be undertaken through the project or some other reason.
