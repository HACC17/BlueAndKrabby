**[§39A-327] Refunding special purpose revenue bonds.** By act enacted by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members to which each house is entitled, the legislature may authorize the issuance of refunding special purpose revenue bonds for the purpose of refunding any special purpose revenue bonds then outstanding and issued under this part, whether or not the outstanding special purpose revenue bonds have matured or are then subject to redemption. By act enacted by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members to which each house is entitled, the legislature may provide for the issuance of a single issue of special purpose revenue bonds for the combined purposes of:

(1) Financing or refinancing the cost of a project or improvement or expansion thereof; and

(2) Refunding special purpose revenue bonds that shall theretofore have been issued under this part and shall then be outstanding, whether or not the outstanding special purpose revenue bonds have matured or are then subject to redemption.

Nothing in this section shall require or be deemed to require the department to elect to redeem or prepay special purpose revenue bonds being refunded, or to redeem or prepay special purpose revenue bonds being refunded that were issued in the form customarily known as term bonds in accordance with any sinking fund installment schedule specified in any instruments providing for the issuance thereof, or, if the department elects to redeem or prepay any bonds, to redeem or prepay as of any particular date or dates. The issuance of refunding special purpose revenue bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights and remedies of the holders thereof, and the rights, powers, privileges, duties, and obligations of the department with respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this part insofar as the same may be applicable.
