**§40-57.5 Comptroller's acceptance of vouchers for the Hawaii state medicaid program.** The requirements of section 40-56 and section 40-57 to the contrary notwithstanding, the comptroller may, if satisfied as to the adequacy of related internal controls and audit trails, issue warrants for original warrant vouchers without accompanying original bills for payments to vendors of the Hawaii state medicaid program. Whenever the comptroller has given the comptroller's approval for the issuance of warrants under this section without accompanying original bills, the original bills shall be retained by the expending agency vouchering the payment, and shall be made available for authorized referencing, for the period prescribed by section 40-10 for the retention of vouchers, documents and other records or papers before destruction. For purposes of this section, the definition of original bills shall also include computer magnetic tape, computer listings, computer output microfilm, microfiche, and manually produced microfilm.
