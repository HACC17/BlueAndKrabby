The department of education shall submit:

(1) A report to the director of finance ninety days after the close of each fiscal year, which shall be prepared in the form prescribed by the director of finance and shall identify the total amount of funds that will carry over to the next fiscal year; and

(2) A copy of this report to the legislature, as well as a report identifying the carryover of funds on a school-by-school basis, at least twenty days prior to the convening of the next regular session of the legislature.
