**§37-52.4 Criteria for the establishment and continuance of revolving funds.** Revolving funds shall only be established pursuant to an act of the legislature. The legislature, in establishing or reviewing a revolving fund to determine whether it should be continued, shall ensure that the revolving fund:

(1) Serves a need, as demonstrated by:

(A) The purpose of the program to be supported by the fund;

(B) The scope of the program, including financial information on fees to be charged, sources of projected revenue, and costs; and

(C) An explanation of why the program cannot be implemented successfully under the general fund appropriation process;

(2) Reflects a clear nexus between the benefits sought and charges made upon the program users or beneficiaries or a clear link between the program and the sources of revenue, as opposed to serving primarily as a means to provide the program or users with an automatic means of support that is removed from the normal budget and appropriation process;

(3) Provides an appropriate means of financing for the program or activity that is used only when essential to the successful operation of the program or activity; and

(4) Demonstrates the capacity to be financially self-sustaining. [L 2002, c 178, pt of §2; am L 2013, c 130, §5]
