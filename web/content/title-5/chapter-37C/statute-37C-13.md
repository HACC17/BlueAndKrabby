(B) Annual debt service payments to annual appropriations;

(4) An examination of whether projected annual revenues from the source of funding are adequate to pay for the annual debt service on the bonds;

(5) An examination of whether any increase in annual debt service payments on the bonds will cause a commensurate decrease of funds available for operating programs with the same source of funding as the debt service payments;

(6) An assessment of whether the annual debt service obligations of the State for the fiscal years covered by the applicable multi-year program and financial plan are affordable to the State; and

(7) An identification of, and discussion on, any noncompliance or possible noncompliance of the State's actual or planned debt issuance with the state debt management policy.

The director of finance may include any other information in the study deemed appropriate or necessary by the director. [L 2015, c 149, pt of ยง2]
